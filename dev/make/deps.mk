# Incremental building support implementation

# Depends: DIR, _OS
#
# Consists of two parts:
#   - handling of build command line updates (no rebuild if makefile has been changed but resulting command line is same)
#   - generation of source code dependency information for following build procedures:
#       C.COMPILE
#       LINK.STATIC
#
# Debug options:
# DEBUG_INCR_BUILDING = yes
# 	- to log decisions made on whether target should be recompiled and why
# DEBUG_INCR_BUILDING_EVAL = yes
#   - to log macro enhancements before evaluation
#

#
# Args:
#   $1: Macro to enhance with dep generation.
#       After injection this macro will (at least) keep dependency of target file on makefiles
#       and monitor whether build command change (i.e. change of its (macro's) own value for particular target file),
#       or change of some other macro (see arg $3)
#   $2: [optional]
#       Line to evaluate and execute instead of original macro.
#       This (if supplied) is supposed to enhance original macro with source code dependency generation.
#       Original macro can be accessed via value of SELF macro.
#       If not set, plain original macro ($1) will be executed.
#   $3: [optional]
#       Line, which evaluated value will be monitored and used to trigger rebuild in case of makefile change.
#       If not set, then change of original macro value (i.e. build command) will be monitored.

# Incremental building support implementation notes {
# ---

# 1. Split compound rules to let make to discover dependencies on its own
# 2. Don't explicitly remove intermediate files if you want to keep dependency information!
#    let make itself to decide when to delete intermediate files (see '10.4 Chains of Implicit Rules')
# 3. asm sources does not heavily depend on other files
#    if deps are needed, then first move compilation to yasm (which supports dep files generation)
#    asm rules are in the form: $(ASM) $< $(AOUT)$@
# 4. fortran deps handling needs to be done only for ifort,
#    other fortrans files (gfortran, pgf95) are generated by icl preprocessor which also produces dep's information
# 5. obvious: do not do any cd in target recipes before compilation as it will break relative source path ($<) passed by make to rule recipe
