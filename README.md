Intel&reg; oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) is a powerful machine learning library that helps speed up big data analysis. oneDAL solvers are also used in [Intel Distribution for Python](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/distribution-for-python.html) for scikit-learn optimization.

Intel&reg; oneAPI Data Analytics Library is an extension of Intel&reg; Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel&reg; DAAL).

## Build your high-performance data science application with oneDAL <!-- omit in toc -->

oneDAL uses all capabilities of Intel&reg; hardware, which allows you to get a significant performance boost for the classic machine learning algorithms.

We provide highly optimized algorithmic building blocks for all stages of data analytics: **preprocessing**, **transformation**, **analysis**, **modeling**, **validation**, and **decision making**.

oneDAL also provides Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) API extensions to the traditional C++ interfaces.

The size of the data is growing exponentially as does the need for high-performance and scalable frameworks to analyze all this data and benefit from it.
Besides superior performance on a single node, oneDAL also provides distributed computation mode that shows excellent results for strong and weak scaling:

>*Technical details: FPType: float32; HW: Intel Xeon Processor E5-2698 v3 @2.3GHz, 2 sockets, 16 cores per socket; SW: Intel® DAAL (2019.3), MPI4Py (3.0.0), Intel® Distribution Of Python (IDP) 3.6.8; Details available in the article https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11822*

Refer to our [examples](#examples) and [documentation](#documentation) for more information about our API.

## Python API

oneDAL has a Python API that is provided as a standalone Python library called [daal4py](https://github.com/intel/scikit-learn-intelex/tree/master/daal4py).

The example below shows how daal4py can be used to calculate K-Means clusters:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import daal4py as d4p

data = pd.read_csv("local_kmeans_data.csv", dtype = np.float32)

init_alg = d4p.kmeans_init(nClusters = 10,
                           fptype = "float",
                           method = "randomDense")

centroids = init_alg.compute(data).centroids
alg = d4p.kmeans(nClusters = 10, maxIterations = 50, fptype = "float",
                 accuracyThreshold = 0, assignFlag = False)
result = alg.compute(data, centroids)
```

### Distributed multi-node mode

Data scientists often require different tools for analysis of regular and big data. daal4py offers various processing models, which makes it easy to enable distributed multi-node mode.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import daal4py as d4p

d4p.daalinit() # <-- Initialize SPMD mode
data = pd.read_csv("local_kmeans_data.csv", dtype = np.float32)

init_alg = d4p.kmeans_init(nClusters = 10,
                           fptype = "float",
                           method = "randomDense",
                           distributed = True) # <-- change model to distributed

centroids = init_alg.compute(data).centroids

alg = d4p.kmeans(nClusters = 10, maxIterations = 50, fptype = "float",
                 accuracyThreshold = 0, assignFlag = False,
                 distributed = True)  # <-- change model to distributed

result = alg.compute(data, centroids)
```

## Scikit-learn patching

You can speed up Scikit-learn using [Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn*](https://intel.github.io/scikit-learn-intelex/).

Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn* speeds up scikit-learn beyond  by providing drop-in patching. Acceleration is achieved through the use of the Intel(R) oneAPI Data Analytics Library that allows for fast usage of the framework suited for Data Scientists or Machine Learning users.

| *Speedup of Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn\* over the original scikit-learn, 28 cores, 1 thread/core* |
|:--:|
| ![](docs/readme-charts/IDP%20scikit-learn%20accelearation%20compared%20with%20stock%20scikit-learn.png) |
| *Technical details: FPType: float32; HW: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8276L CPU @ 2.20GHz, 2 sockets, 28 cores per socket; SW: scikit-learn 0.22.2, Intel® DAAL (2019.5), Intel® Distribution Of Python (IDP) 3.7.4; Details available in the article https://medium.com/intel-analytics-software/accelerate-your-scikit-learn-applications-a06cacf44912* |

Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn* provides an option to replace some scikit-learn methods by oneDAL solvers, which makes it possible to get a performance gain **without any code changes**. You can patch the stock scikit-learn by using the following command-line flag:
```bash
python -m sklearnex my_application.py
```
Patches can also be enabled programmatically:
```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from time import time

svm_sklearn = SVC(kernel="rbf", gamma="scale", C=0.5)

digits = load_digits()
X, y = digits.data, digits.target

start = time()
svm_sklearn = svm_sklearn.fit(X, y)
end = time()
print(end - start) # output: 0.141261...
print(svm_sklearn.score(X, y)) # output: 0.9905397885364496

from sklearnex import patch_sklearn
patch_sklearn() # <-- apply patch
from sklearn.svm import SVC

svm_sklearnex = SVC(kernel="rbf", gamma="scale", C=0.5)

start = time()
svm_sklearnex = svm_sklearnex.fit(X, y)
end = time()
print(end - start) # output: 0.032536...
print(svm_sklearnex.score(X, y)) # output: 0.9905397885364496
```

## Technical Preview Features

Technical preview features are introduced to gain early feedback from developers. A technical preview feature is subject to change in the future releases. Using a technical preview feature in a production code base is therefore strongly discouraged.

In C++ APIs, technical preview features are located in `daal::preview` and `oneapi::dal::preview` namespaces. In Java APIs, technical preview features are located in packages that have the `com.intel.daal.preview` name prefix.

The preview features list:
- Graph Analytics:
	- Undirected graph without edge and vertex weights (`undirected_adjacency_vector_graph`), where vertex indices can only be of type int32
  - Directed graph with and without edge weights (`directed_adjacency_vector_graph`), where vertex indices can only be of type int32, edge weights can be of type int32 or double
	- Jaccard Similarity Coefficients for all pairs of vertices, a batch algorithm that processes the graph by blocks
  - Local and Global Triangle Counting
  - Single Source Shortest Paths (SSSP)
  - Subgraph isomorphism algorithm for induced and non-induced subgraphs in undirected graphs (integer vertex attributes are supported, edge attributes are not supported).
