oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) is a powerful machine learning library that helps you accelerate big data analysis at all stages: **preprocessing**, **transformation**, **analysis**, **modeling**, **validation**, and **decision making**.

The library implements classical machine learning algorithms. The boost in their performance is achieved by leveraging the capabilities of Intel&reg; hardware.

The oneDAL is part of the [UXL Foundation](http://www.uxlfoundation.org) and is an implementation of the [oneAPI specification](https://spec.oneapi.io) for oneDAL component.

## Usage

There are different ways for you to build high-performance data science applications that use the advantages of oneDAL:
- Use oneDAL C++ interfaces with or without SYCL support ([learn more](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDAL/#oneapi-vs-daal-interfaces))
- Use [Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn*](https://intel.github.io/scikit-learn-intelex/) to accelerate existing scikit-learn code without changing it
- Use [daal4py](https://github.com/intel/scikit-learn-intelex/tree/main/daal4py), a standalone package with Python API for oneDAL
Deprecation Notice: The Java interfaces are removed from the oneDAL library.


## Installation

Check the [System Requirements](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDAL/system-requirements.html) before installing to ensure compatibility with your system.

There are several options available for installing oneDAL:

- **Binary Distribution**: You can download pre-built binary packages from the following sources:
    - Intel® oneAPI:
