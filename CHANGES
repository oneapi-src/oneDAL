Intel(R) Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel(R) DAAL) Update 1

Changes (w.r.t. Intel DAAL 2017):

Added batch processing mode for k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm

Added distributed processing mode for neural network training to support distributed parallel data processing

Added diagonal variance-covariance matrices and controls to treat degenerated covariance matrices to Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) 

Added k-means++ and k-means|| initialization methods for K-Means clustering

Added the Gaussian initializer for neural network model parameters (weights and biases) 

Added min-max normalization algorithm

Added multiple ground truth tensors and multiple result tensors to neural networks training and inference stages, respectively

Added optional arguments and results to the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm to enable the resumption of computation from a paused state

Added support for merging the numeric tables by rows

Added support for symmetric and triangular packed numeric tables in Java*

Improved performance in the following functionalities:
- Neural network training and inference, including support for batch processing mode on the inference stage
- Local response normalization forward and backward layers and two-dimensional (2D) max pooling forward and backward layers
- Absolute value (abs) and hyperbolic tangent (tanh) backward layers
- Cosine distance for result in lower triangular matrix layout and correlation distance for result in full, lower, and upper triangular matrix layouts
- Moments of low order
- Z-score normalization
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Kernel functions for CSR numeric tables
- CSV feature manager

Fixed bugs for the following components:
- Multi-class classifier
- Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) optimization solver
- Documentation

Open-source contributions integrated:
- Fixed redundant atomic class definition, by Ethanlm
