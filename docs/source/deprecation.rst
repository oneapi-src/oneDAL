**Deprecation:** The Java* interfaces in the oneDAL library are marked as deprecated. The future releases of the oneDAL library may no longer include support for these Java* interfaces.

**Reasons for deprecation:** The ongoing efforts to optimize oneDAL resources and focus strongly on the most widely used features.

**Alternatives:** Intel(R) Optimized Analytics Package* (OAP) project for the Spark* users.
The project offers a comprehensive set of optimized libraries, including the OAP* MLlib* component. For more information, visit https://github.com/oap-project/oap-mllib.


DAAL CPP SYCL Interfaces
************************

**Deprecation:** The `DAAL CPP SYCL Interfaces <https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDAL/tree/main/examples/daal/cpp_sycl>`_ in the oneDAL library are deprecated. Starting with the 2024.0 release, oneDAL will not support the DAAL CPP SYCL Interfaces.

**Reasons for deprecation:** Deprecating initial version of SYCL interfaces in favour of oneDAL SYCL interfaces. The ongoing efforts to optimize oneDAL resources and focus strongly on the most widely used features.

**Alternatives:** `oneDAL SYCL interfaces <https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDAL/tree/main/examples/oneapi/dpc>`_


Compression Functionality
*************************

**Deprecation:** The compression functionality in the oneDAL library is deprecated. Starting with the 2024.0 release, oneDAL will not support the compression functionality.

**Reasons for deprecation:** The ongoing efforts to optimize oneDAL resources and focus strongly on the most widely used features.

**Alternatives:** The external compression mechanics with optimized into your application implementation. For example, Intel(R) IPP.

ABI Compatibility
