Build and Run Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Perform the following steps to build and run examples demonstrating the
basic usage scenarios of |short_name| with DPCPP. Go to
:file:`<install_dir>/dal/<version>` and then set up an environment as shown in the example below:

.. note::

   All content below that starts with ``#`` is considered a comment and
   should not be run with the code.

#. Set up the required environment for |short_name|
   (variables such as ``CPATH``, ``LIBRARY_PATH``, and ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``):

   .. tabs::

      .. group-tab:: Linux

         On Linux, there are two possible ways to set up the required environment:
         via ``vars.sh`` script or via ``modulefiles``.

         * To set up |short_name| environment via ``vars.sh`` script, run ``source ./env/vars.sh``. 
         * To set up |short_name| environment via ``setvars.sh`` script, run ``source ./setvars.sh``. 
         * To set up |short_name| environment via ``modulefiles``:

           #. Initialize ``modules``:

              .. code-block:: bash

                 source $MODULESHOME/init/bash

              .. note:: Refer to `Environment Modules documentation <https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for details.

           #. Provide ``modules`` with a path to the ``modulefiles`` directory:

              .. code-block:: bash

                 module use ./modulefiles

           #. Run the module:

              .. code-block:: bash

                 module load dal

      .. group-tab:: Windows

         To set up |short_name| environment, run ``source /env/vars.bat`` or ``source setvars.bat``. 

#. Copy ``./examples/oneapi/dpc`` to a writable directory if necessary (since it creates temporary files):

   .. code-block:: bash

      cp –r ./examples/oneapi/dpc ${WRITABLE_DIR}

#. Set up the compiler environment for |dpcpp|.
   See |dpcpp_gsg|_ for details.

#. Build and run examples:

   .. note::

      You need to have write permissions to the :file:`examples` folder
      to build examples, and execute permissions to run them.
      Otherwise, you need to copy :file:`examples/oneapi/dpc` and :file:`examples/oneapi/data` folders
      to the directory with right permissions. These two folders must be retained
      in the same directory level relative to each other.

   .. tabs::

      .. group-tab:: Linux

         .. code-block:: bash

           # Navigate to examples directory and build examples
           cd /examples/oneapi/dpc
           cmake -G "Unix Makefiles⁮" -DEXAMPLES_LIST=svm_two_class_thunder # This would generate makefiles for all svm examples matching passed name
           make               # This will compile and run generated svm examples
           cmake -G "Unix Makefiles⁮" -DONEDAL_LINK=static # This wouldgenerate make for static version
           make               # This will compile and run all the examples

      .. group-tab:: Windows

         .. code-block:: bash

            # Navigate to examples directory and build examples
            cd /examples/oneapi/dpc
           cmake  -G "NMake Makefiles" -DEXAMPLES_LIST=svm_two_class_thunder # This would generate makefiles for all svm examples matching passed name
           nmake             # This will compile and run generated svm examples
           cmake  -G "NMake Makefiles" -DONEDAL_LINK=static # This wouldgenerate make for static version
           nmake              # This will compile and run all the examples


#. The resulting example binaries and log files are written into the :file:`_results` directory.

   .. note::

      You should run the examples from :file:`examples/oneapi/dpc` folder, not from :file:`_results` folder.
      Most examples require data to be stored in :file:`examples/oneapi/data` folder and to have a relative link to it
      started from :file:`examples/oneapi/dpc` folder.


   You can build traditional C++ examples located in ``examples/oneapi/cpp`` folder in a similar way.
