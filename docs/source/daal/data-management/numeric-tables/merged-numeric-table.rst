Merged Numeric Table

|product| offers the ``MergedNumericTable`` class for tables that
provides access to data sets comprising several logical components,
such as a set of feature vectors and corresponding labels. This type
of tables enables you to read those data components from one data
source. This special type of numeric tables can hold several numeric
tables of any type but ``CSRNumericTable``. In a merged numeric table,
arrays are joined by columns and therefore can have different numbers
of columns. In the case of different numbers of rows in input
matrices, the number of rows in a merged table equals :math:`min(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_m)`,
where :math:`r_i` is the number of
rows in the i-th matrix, :math:`i = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, m`.
