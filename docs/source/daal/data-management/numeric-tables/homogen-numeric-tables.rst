Homogeneous Numeric Tables
==========================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

Use homogeneous numeric tables, that is, objects of the
``HomogenNumericTable`` class, and matrices, that is, objects of the
``Matrix``, ``PackedTriangularMatrix``, and ``PackedSymmetricMatrix`` classes,
when all the features are of the same basic data type. Values of the
features are laid out in memory as one contiguous block in the
row-major order, that is, *Observation 1*, *Observation 2*, and so on. In
|product|, ``Matrix`` is a homogeneous numeric table most suitable for
matrix algebra operations.

For triangular and symmetric matrices with reduced memory footprint,
special classes are available: ``PackedTriangularMatrix`` and
``PackedSymmetricMatrix``. Use the DataLayout enumeration to choose
between representations of triangular and symmetric matrices:

-  Lower packed: ``lowerPackedSymetricMatrix`` or ``lowerPackedTriangularMatrix``
-  Upper packed: ``upperPackedTriangularMatrix`` or ``upperPackedSymetricMatrix``
