Managing Memory
===============

To improve performance of your application that calls |short_name|,
align your arrays on 64-byte boundaries and ensure that the leading
dimensions of the arrays are divisible by 64. For that purpose |short_name|
provides ``daal_malloc()`` and ``daal_free()`` functions to allocate and
deallocate memory.

To allocate memory, ``call daal_malloc()`` with the specified size of the
buffer to be allocated and the alignment of the buffer, which must be
a power of 2. If the specified alignment is not a power of 2, the
library uses the 32-byte alignment.

To deallocate memory allocated earlier by the ``daal_malloc()`` function,
call the ``daal_free()`` function and set a pointer to the buffer to be freed.
