This mode assumes that the data set is split into ``nblocks`` blocks across computation nodes.

.. _moments_step_1:

Step 1 - on Local Nodes
***********************

In this step, the low order moments algorithm accepts the input described below.
Pass the ``Input ID`` as a parameter to the methods that provide input for your algorithm.
For more details, see :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Algorithm Input for Low Order Moments (Distributed Processing, Step 1)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input ID
     - Input
   * - ``data``
     - Pointer to the numeric table of size :math:`n_i \times p` that represents the :math:`i`-th data block on the local node.

       While the input for ``defaultDense``, ``singlePassDense``, or ``sumDense`` method can be an object of any class derived
       from ``NumericTable``, the input for ``fastCSR``, ``singlePassCSR``, or ``sumCSR`` method can only be an object of
       the ``CSRNumericTable`` class.

In this step, the low order moments algorithm calculates the results described below.
Pass the ``Result ID`` as a parameter to the methods that access the results of your algorithm.
For more details, see :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Algorithm Output for Low Order Moments (Distributed Processing, Step 1)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Result ID
     - Result
   * - ``nObservations``
     - Pointer to the :math:`1 \times 1` numeric table that contains the number of observations processed so far on the local node.

       By default, this result is an object of the ``HomogenNumericTable`` class, but you can define the result
       as an object of any class derived from ``NumericTable`` except ``CSRNumericTable``.

Partial characteristics computed so far on the local node, each in a :math:`1 \times p` numeric table.
By default, each table is an object of the ``HomogenNumericTable`` class, but you can define the tables as objects
of any class derived from ``NumericTable`` except ``PackedSymmetricMatrix``, ``PackedTriangularMatrix``, and ``CSRNumericTable``.

Pass the ``Input ID`` as a parameter to the methods that provide input for your algorithm.
For more details, see :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Algorithm Input for Low Order Moments (Distributed Processing, Step 2)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input ID
     - Input
   * - ``partialResults``
     - A collection that contains numeric tables with partial results computed in :ref:`Step 1 <moments_step_1>` on local nodes (six numeric tables from each local node).
       These numeric tables can be objects of any class derived from the ``NumericTable`` class except ``PackedSymmetricMatrix`` and ``PackedTriangularMatrix``.

In this step, the low order moments algorithm calculates the results described in the following table.
Pass the ``Result ID`` as a parameter to the methods that access the results of your algorithm.
For more details, see :ref:`algorithms`.

.. note::

    Each result is a pointer to the :math:`1 \times p` numeric table that contains characteristics for each feature in the data set.
    By default, the tables are objects of the ``HomogenNumericTable`` class,
    but you can define each table as an object of any class derived from ``NumericTable``
    except ``PackedSymmetricMatrix``, ``PackedTriangularMatrix``, and ``CSRNumericTable``.
