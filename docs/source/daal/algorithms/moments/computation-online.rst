Online Processing
=================

Online processing computation mode assumes that data arrives in blocks :math:`i = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \text{nblocks}`.

Computation of low order moments in the online processing mode follows the general computation schema
for online processing described in :ref:`algorithms`.

Algorithm Input
***************

The low order moments algorithm accepts the input described below.
Pass the ``Input ID`` as a parameter to the methods that provide input for your algorithm.
For more details, see :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Algorithm Input for Low Order Moments (Online Processing)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input ID
     - Input
   * - ``data``
     - Pointer to the numeric table of size :math:`n_i \times p` that represents the current data block.

       While the input for ``defaultDense``, ``singlePassDense``, or ``sumDense`` method can be an object of any class derived
       from ``NumericTable``, the input for ``fastCSR``, ``singlePassCSR``, or ``sumCSR`` method can only be an object of
       the ``CSRNumericTable`` class.

Algorithm Parameters
********************

The low order moments algorithm has the following parameters:

   :widths: 10 10 60
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: longtable

   * - Parameter
     - Default Valude
     - Description
   * - ``algorithmFPType``
     - ``float``
     - The floating-point type that the algorithm uses for intermediate computations. Can be ``float`` or ``double``.
   * - ``method``
     - ``defaultDense``
     - Available methods for computation of low order moments:

       defaultDense
           default performance-oriented method

       singlePassDense
           implementation of the single-pass algorithm proposed by D.H.D. West

       sumDense
           implementation of the algorithm in the cases where the basic statistics associated with
           the numeric table are pre-computed sums; returns an error if pre-computed sums are not defined

       fastCSR
           performance-oriented method for CSR numeric tables

       singlePassCSR
           implementation of the single-pass algorithm proposed by D.H.D. West; optimized for CSR numeric tables

       sumCSR
           implementation of the algorithm in the cases where the basic statistics associated with
           the numeric table are pre-computed sums; optimized for CSR numeric tables;
           returns an error if pre-computed sums are not defined

   * - ``initializationProcedure``
     - Not applicable
     - The procedure for setting initial parameters of the algorithm in the online processing mode.

       By default, the algorithm does the following initialization:

       - Sets ``nObservations``, ``partialSum``, and ``partialSumSquares`` to zero.
       - Sets ``partialMinimum`` and ``partialMaximum`` to the first row of the input table.

   * - ``estimatesToCompute``
     - ``estimatesAll``
     - Estimates to be computed by the algorithm:

       - ``estimatesAll`` - all supported moments
       - ``estimatesMinMax`` - minimum and maximum
       - ``estimatesMeanVariance`` - mean and variance

Partial Results
***************

The low order moments algorithm in the online processing mode calculates partial results described below.
Pass the ``Result ID`` as a parameter to the methods that access the results of your algorithm.
For more details, see :ref:`algorithms`.

   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Result ID
     - Result
   * - ``nObservations``
     - Pointer to the :math:`1 \times 1` numeric table that contains the number of rows processed so far.

       By default, this result is an object of the ``HomogenNumericTable`` class, but you can define the result
       as an object of any class derived from ``NumericTable`` except ``CSRNumericTable``.

Partial characteristics computed so far, each in a :math:`1 \times p` numeric table.
By default, each table is an object of the ``HomogenNumericTable`` class, but you can define the tables as objects
of any class derived from ``NumericTable`` except ``PackedSymmetricMatrix``, ``PackedTriangularMatrix``, and ``CSRNumericTable``.
