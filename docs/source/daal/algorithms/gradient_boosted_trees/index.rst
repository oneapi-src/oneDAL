Gradient Boosted Trees
======================

The library provides gradient boosted trees classification and
regression algorithms based on an ensemble of regression (decision)
trees trained using stochastic gradient boosting technique.
*Regression tree* is a binary tree graph. Its internal (split) nodes
represent a *decision function* used to select following (child) node
at prediction stage. Its leaf (terminal) nodes represent the
corresponding response values which are the result of prediction from
the tree. For more details, see Decision Tree [Breiman84]_.
