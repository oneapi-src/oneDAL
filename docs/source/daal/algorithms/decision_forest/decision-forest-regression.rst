Regression Decision Forest
--------------------------

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 4

Decision forest regression is a special case of the :ref:`decision_forest` model.

Details
=======

Given:

- :math:`n` feature vectors :math:`X = \{x_1 = (x_{11}, \ldots, x_{1p}), \ldots, x_n = (x_{n1}, \ldots, x_{np}) \}`
  of size :math:`p`;
- their non-negative sample weights :math:`w = (w_1, \ldots, w_n)`;
- the vector of responses :math:`y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n)`

The problem is to build a decision forest regression model that minimizes the Mean-Square Error (MSE) between the predicted and true value.

Training Stage
**************

Decision forest regression follows the algorithmic framework of decision forest training algorithm
based on the mean-squared error (MSE) [Breiman84]_.
If sample weights are provided as input, the library uses a weighted version of the algorithm.

MSE is an impurity metric (:math:`D` is a set of observations that reach the node), calculated as follows:

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Decision Forest Regression: impurity calculations
   :widths: 10 10
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left
   :class: longtable

   * - Without sample weights
     - With sample weights
   * - :math:`I_{\mathrm{MSE}}\left(D\right) = \frac{1}{W(D)} \sum _{i=1}^{W(D)}{\left(y_i - \frac{1}{W(D)} \sum _{j=1}^{W(D)} y_j \right)}^{2}`
     - :math:`I_{\mathrm{MSE}}\left(D\right) = \frac{1}{W(D)} \sum _{i \in D}{w_i \left(y_i - \frac{1}{W(D)} \sum _{j \in D} w_j y_j \right)}^{2}`
   * - :math:`W(S) = \sum_{s \in S} 1`, which is equivalent to the number of elements in :math:`S`
     - :math:`W(S) = \sum_{s \in S} w_s`


Prediction Stage
****************

Given decision forest regression model and vectors :math:`x_1, \ldots, x_r`, the problem is to calculate the responses for those
vectors. To solve the problem for each given query vector :math:`x_i`, the algorithm finds the leaf node in a tree in the
forest that gives the response by that tree as the mean of
dependent variables. The forest predicts the response as the mean
of responses from trees.


Out-of-bag Error
****************

Decision forest regression follows the algorithmic framework for
calculating the decision forest out-of-bag (OOB) error, where
aggregation of the out-of-bag predictions in all trees and
calculation of the OOB error of the decision forest is done as
follows:

-  For each vector :math:`x_i` in the dataset :math:`X`, predict its response :math:`\hat{y_i}`
   as the mean of prediction from the trees that contain :math:`x_i` in their OOB set:

   :math:`\hat{y_i} = \frac{1}{{|B}_{i}|}\sum _{b=1}^{|B_i|}\hat{y_{ib}}`, where :math:`B_i= \bigcup{T_b}: x_i \in \overline{D_b}` and :math:`\hat{y_{ib}}` is the result of prediction
   :math:`x_i` by :math:`T_b`.

-  Calculate the OOB error of the decision forest T as the Mean-Square Error (MSE):

   .. math::
		OOB(T) = \frac{1}{|{D}^{\text{'}}|}\sum _{{y}_{i} \in {D}^{\text{'}}}\sum {(y_i-\hat{y_i})}^{2}, \text{where } {D}^{\text{'}}={\bigcup}_{b=1}^{B}\overline{{D}_{b}}

-  If OOB error value per each observation is required, then calculate the prediction error for :math:`x_i`:

   .. math::
		OOB(x_i) = {(y_i-\hat{y_i})}^{2}


Batch Processing
================

Decision forest regression follows the general workflow described in :ref:`decision_forest`.
