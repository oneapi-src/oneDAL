Working with User-defined Quality Metrics
=========================================

In addition to or instead of the metrics available in the library, you can use your own quality metrics. To do this:

#. Add your own implementation of the quality metrics algorithm and define Input and Result classes for that algorithm.

#. Register this new algorithm in the ``inputAlgorithms`` collection of the quality metric set.
   Also register the input objects for the new algorithm in the ``inputData`` collection of the quality metric set.

Use the unique key when registering the new algorithm and its input, and use the same key to obtain the computed results.
