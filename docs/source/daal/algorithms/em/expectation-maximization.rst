Expectation-Maximization
************************

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 4


Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative method for
finding the maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimates of
parameters in models that typically depend on hidden variables.

While serving as a clustering technique, EM is also used in
non-linear dimensionality reduction, missing value problems, and
other areas.


Details
=======

Given a set :math:`X` of :math:`n` feature vectors :math:`x_1 = (x_{11}, \ldots, x_{1p}), \ldots, x_n = (x_{n1}, \ldots, x_{np})`
of dimension :math:`p`, the problem is to find a maximum-likelihood estimate of
the parameters of the underlying distribution when the data is
incomplete or has missing values.


Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm in the General Form
-----------------------------------------------------------

Let :math:`X` be the observed data which has log-likelihood :math:`l(\theta; X)`
depending on the parameters :math:`\theta`. Let :math:`X^m` be the latent or
missing data, so that :math:`T=(X, X^m)` is the complete data with
log-likelihood :math:`l_0(\theta; X)`. The algorithm for solving the
problem in its general form is the following EM algorithm
([Dempster77]_,
[Hastie2009]_):

#. Choose initial values of the parameters :math:`\theta^{(0)}`.

#.

 *Expectation step*: in the :math:`j`-th step, compute :math:`Q(\theta', \theta^{(j)}) = E (l_0(\theta'; T) | X, \theta^{(j)})` as a
 function of the dummy argument :math:`\theta'`.

#.

 *Maximization step*: in the :math:`j`-th step, calculate the new
 estimate :math:`\theta^{(j+1)}` by maximizing :math:`Q(\theta', \theta^{(j)})` over :math:`\theta'`.

#.

 Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.


EM algorithm for the Gaussian Mixture Model
-------------------------------------------

Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a mixture of k p-dimensional
multivariate Gaussian distributions represented as

.. math::
	F\left(x{|\alpha }_{1},\ldots,{\alpha }_{k};{\theta }_{1},\ldots,{\theta }_{k}\right)=\sum _{i=1}^{k}{\alpha }_{i}{\int }_{-\infty }^{x}pd\left(y|{\theta }_{i}\right),

where :math:`\sum _{i=1}^{k}{\alpha_i} = 1` and :math:`\alpha_i \geq 0`.

The :math:`pd(x|\theta_i)` is the probability density function with
parameters :math:`\theta_i = (m_i, \Sigma_i)`, where :math:`m_i`
the vector of means, and :math:`\Sigma_i` is the
variance-covariance matrix. The probability density function for a
:math:`p`-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution is defined as
follows:

.. math::
	pd\left(x|{\theta }_{i}\right)=\frac{\mathrm{exp}\left(-\frac{1}{2}{\left(x-{m}_{i}\right)}^{T}\sum _{i}^{-1}\left(x-{m}_{i}\right)\right)}{\sqrt{{\left(2\pi \right)}^{p}|\sum _{i}|}}.

Let :math:`x_{ij} = I\{x_i \text{belongs to j mixture component}\}` be
the indicator function and :math:`\theta = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_k; \theta_1, \ldots, \theta_k)`.


Computation
+++++++++++

The EM algorithm for GMM includes the following steps:

Define the weights as follows:

.. math::
	{w}_{ij}=\frac{pd\left({x}_{i}|{z}_{ij},{\theta }_{j}\right){\alpha }_{j}}{\sum _{r=1}^{k}pd\left({x}_{i}|{z}_{ir},{\theta }_{r}\right){\alpha }_{r}}

for :math:`i = 1, \ldots, n` and :math:`j=1, \ldots, k`.

#. Choose initial values of the parameters: :math:`{\theta }^{\left(0\right)}=\left({\alpha }_{1}^{\left(0\right)},...,{\alpha }_{k}^{\left(0\right)};{\theta }_{1}^{\left(0\right)},...,{\theta }_{k}^{\left(0\right)}\right)`


#. *Expectation step*: in the :math:`j`-th step, compute the matrix :math:`W = {(w_{ij})}_{nxk}` with the weights :math:`w_{ij}`

#. Maximization step: in the :math:`j`-th step, for all :math:`r=1, \ldots, k` compute:

   a.
     The mixture weights :math:`{\alpha }_{r}^{\left(j+1\right)}=\frac{{n}_{r}}{n}`, where :math:`{n}_{r}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{w}_{ir}`
     is the "amount" of the feature vectors that are assigned
     to the :math:`r`-th mixture component

   b. Mean estimates :math:`{m}_{r}^{\left(j+1\right)}=\frac{1}{{n}_{r}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}{w}_{ir}{x}_{i}`

   c.
     Covariance estimate :math:`\sum _{r}^{(j+1)}=({\sigma }_{r,hg}^{(j+1)})`
     of size :math:`p \times p` with :math:`\sigma_{r,hg}^{(j+1)}=\frac{1}{n_r}\sum_{l=1}^{n}{w}_{lr}(x_{lh}-m_{r,h}^{(j+1)})(x_{lg}-m_{r,g}^{(j+1)})`


#. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until any of these conditions is met:

   - :math:`|\log({\theta }^{(j+1)}-{\theta }^{(j)})|<\epsilon`, where the likelihood function is:

     :math:`\log(\theta)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\log(\sum _{j=1}^{k}{pd(x}_{i}|{z}_{j},{\theta }_{j}){\alpha }_{j})`

   - The number of iterations exceeds the predefined level.

Initialization
++++++++++++++

The EM algorithm for GMM requires initialized vector of
weights, vectors of means, and variance-covariance
[Biernacki2003, Maitra2009].

The EM initialization algorithm for GMM includes the following
steps:

#. Perform nTrials starts of the EM algorithm with nIterations
   iterations and start values:

   - Initial means - :math:`k` different random observations from the input data set
   - Initial weights - the values of :math:`1/k`
   - Initial covariance matrices - the covariance of the input data

#. Regard the result of the best EM algorithm in terms of the
   likelihood function values as the result of initialization

Initialization
==============

The EM algorithm for GMM requires initialized vector of weights,
vectors of means, and variance-covariance. Skip the initialization
step if you already calculated initial weights, means, and
covariance matrices.

Performance Considerations
==========================

To get the best overall performance of the expectation-maximization
algorithm at the initialization and computation stages:

-  If input data is homogeneous, provide the input data and store
   results in homogeneous numeric tables of the same type as
   specified in the algorithmFPType class template parameter.
-  If input data is non-homogeneous, use AOS layout rather than SOA layout.
