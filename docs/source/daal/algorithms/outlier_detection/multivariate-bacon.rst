Multivariate BACON Outlier Detection
====================================

In multivariate outlier detection methods, the observation point is the entire feature vector.

Details
*******

Given a set :math:`X` of :math:`n` feature vectors
:math:`x_1 = (x_{11}, \ldots, x_{1p}), \ldots, x_n = (x_{n1}, \ldots, x_{np})` of dimension :math:`p`,
the problem is to identify the vectors that do not belong to the underlying distribution using the BACON method (see [Billor2000]_).

In the iterative method, each iteration involves several steps:

#. Identify an initial basic subset of :math:`m > p` feature vectors that can be assumed as not containing outliers.
   The constant :math:`m` is set to :math:`5p`. The library supports two approaches to selecting the initial subset:

   - Based on distances from the medians :math:`||x_i - \text{med}||`, where:

     - `med` is the vector of coordinate-wise medians
     - :math:`||.||` is the vector norm
     - :math:`i = 1, \ldots, n`

   - Based on the Mahalanobis distance :math:`d_i (\text{mean}, S) = \sqrt {(x_i - \text{mean})^T s^{-1} (x_i - \text{mean})}`, where:

     - `mean` and :math:`S` are the mean and the covariance matrix, respectively, of :math:`n` feature vectors
     - :math:`i = 1, \ldots, n`

   Each method chooses :math:`m` feature vectors with the smallest values of distances.

#. Compute the discrepancies using the Mahalanobis distance above, where mean and S are the mean and the covariance matrix, respectively, computed for the feature vectors contained in the basic subset.

#. Set the new basic subset to all feature vectors with the discrepancy less than :math:`c_{npr}\chi_{p, \frac {\alpha}{n}}^2`,
   where:

   - :math:`chi_{p, \alpha}^2` is the :math:`(1 - \alpha)` percentile of the Chi-square distribution with :math:`p` degrees of freedom
   - :math:`c_{npr} = c_{hr} + c_{np}`, where:

     - :math:`r` is the size of the current basic subset
     - :math:`c_{hr} = \max \{0, \frac {h - r}{h + r}\}`, where :math:`h = [\frac{n + p + 1}{2}]` and :math:`[ ]` is the integer part of a number
     - :math:`c_{np} = 1 + \frac{p + 1}{n - p} + \frac{2}{n - 1 - 3p}`

#. Iterate steps 2 and 3 until the size of the basic subset no longer changes.

#. Nominate the feature vectors that are not part of the final basic subset as outliers.

Algorithm Input
---------------

The multivariate BACON outlier detection algorithm accepts the input described below.
Pass the ``Input ID`` as a parameter to the methods that provide input for your algorithm.
For more details, see :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Algorithm Input for Multivariate BACON Outlier Detection (Batch Processing)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input ID
     - Input
   * - ``data``
     - Pointer to the :math:`n \times p` numeric table with the data for outlier detection.

       .. note:: The input can be an object of any class derived from the ``NumericTable`` class.

Algorithm Parameters
--------------------

The multivariate BACON outlier detection algorithm has the following parameters:

   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 10 60
   :align: left
   :class: longtable

   * - Parameter
     - Default Value
     - Description
   * - ``algorithmFPType``
     - ``float``
     - The floating-point type that the algorithm uses for intermediate computations. Can be ``float`` or ``double``.
   * - ``initializationMethod``
     - ``baconMedian``
     - The initialization method, can be:

       - ``baconMedian`` - median-based method
       - ``defaultDense`` - Mahalanobis distance-based method
   * - ``alpha``
     - :math:`0.05`
     - One-tailed probability that defines the :math:`(1 - \alpha)` quantile of the :math:`\chi^2` distribution with :math:`p` degrees of freedom.

       Recommended value: :math:`\frac{\alpha}{n}`, where :math:`n` is the number of observations.
   * - ``toleranceToConverge``
     - :math:`0.005`
     - The stopping criterion. The algorithm is terminated if the size of the basic subset is changed by less than the threshold.

Algorithm Output
----------------

The multivariate BACON outlier detection algorithm calculates the result described below.
Pass the ``Result ID`` as a parameter to the methods that access the results of your algorithm.
For more details, see :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Algorithm Output for Multivariate BACON Outlier Detection (Batch Processing)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Result ID
     - Result
   * - ``weights``
     - Pointer to the :math:`n \times 1` numeric table of zeros and ones.
       Zero in the :math:`i`-th position indicates that the :math:`i`-th feature vector is an outlier.

       .. note::
          By default, the result is an object of the ``HomogenNumericTable`` class,
          but you can define the result as an object of any class derived from ``NumericTable``
          except the ``PackedSymmetricMatrix``, ``PackedTriangularMatrix``, and ``CSRNumericTable``.
