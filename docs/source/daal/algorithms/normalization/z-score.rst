Z-score
=======

Z-score normalization is an algorithm that produces data with each feature (column) having zero mean and unit variance.

Details
*******

Given a set :math:`X` of :math:`n` feature vectors :math:`x_1 = (x_{11}, \ldots, x_{1p}), \ldots, x_n = (x_{n1}, \ldots, x_{np})`
of dimension :math:`p`, the problem is to compute the matrix :math:`Y = (y_{ij})` of dimension :math:`n \times p` as following:

.. math::

    y_{ij} = \frac {x_{ij} - m_j} {\Delta}

where:

- :math:`m_j` is the mean of :math:`j`-th component of set :math:`(X)_j`, where :math:`j = \overline{1, p}`
- value of :math:`\Delta` depends omn a computation mode

|short_name| provides two modes for computing the result matrix.
You can enable the mode by setting the flag ``doScale`` to a certain position (for details, see `Algorithm Parameters`_).
The mode may include:

- **Centering only.** In this case, :math:`\Delta = 1` and no scaling is performed.
  After normalization, the mean of :math:`j`-th component of result set :math:`(Y)_j` will be zero.

- **Centering and scaling.** In this case, :math:`\Delta = \sigma_j`, where :math:`\sigma_j`
  is the standard deviation of :math:`j`-th component of set :math:`(X)_j`.
  After normalization, the mean of :math:`j`-th component of result set :math:`(Y)_j` will be zero
  and its variance will get a value of one.

.. note::

    Some algorithms require normalization parameters (mean and variance) as an input.
    The implementation of Z-score algorithm in |short_name| does not return these values by default.
    Enable this option by setting the resultsToCompute flag.
    For details, see `Algorithm Parameters`_.

Algorithm Input
---------------

Z-score normalization algorithm accepts an input as described below.
Pass the ``Input ID`` as a parameter to the methods that provide input for your algorithm.
For more details, see :ref:`algorithms`.

.. list-table:: Algorithm Input for Z-score (Batch Processing)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input ID
     - Input
   * - ``data``
     - Pointer to the numeric table of size :math:`n \times p`.

       .. note:: This table can be an object of any class derived from ``NumericTable``.

Algorithm Parameters
--------------------

Z-score normalization algorithm has the following parameters.
Some of them are required only for specific values of the computation method parameter ``method``:

  * - Parameter
    - method
    - Default Value
    - Description
  * - ``algorithmFPType``
    - ``defaultDense`` or ``sumDense``
    - ``float``
    - The floating-point type that the algorithm uses for intermediate computations. Can be ``float`` or ``double``.
  * - ``method``
    - Not applicable
    - ``defaultDense``
    - Available computation methods:

      defaultDense
        a performance-oriented method. Mean and variance are computed by low order moments algorithm.
        For details, see :ref:`Batch Processing for Moments of Low Order <moments_batch>`.
      sumDense
        a method that uses the basic statistics associated with the numeric table of pre-computed sums.
        Returns an error if pre-computed sums are not defined.
  * - ``moments``
    - ``defaultDense``
    - `SharedPtr<low_order_moments::Batch<algorithmFPType, low_order_moments::defaultDense> >`
    - Pointer to the low order moments algorithm that computes means and standard deviations
      to be used for Z-score normalization with the ``defaultDense`` method.
  * - ``doScale``
    - ``defaultDense`` or ``sumDense``
    - ``true``
    - If true, the algorithm applies both centering and scaling.
      Otherwise, the algorithm provides only centering.
  * - ``resultsToCompute``
    - ``defaultDense`` or ``sumDense``
    - Not applicable
    - *Optional*.

      Pointer to the data collection containing the following key-value pairs for Z-score:

      - ``mean`` - means
      - ``variance`` - variances

      Provide one of these values to request a single characteristic or use bitwise OR to request a combination of them.

Algorithm Output
----------------

Z-score normalization algorithm calculates the result as described below.
Pass the ``Result ID`` as a parameter to the methods that access the results of your algorithm.
For more details, see :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

   * - Result ID
     - Result
   * - ``normalizedData``
     - Pointer to the :math:`n \times p` numeric table that stores the result of normalization.

       .. note::

          By default, the result is an object of the ``HomogenNumericTable`` class,
          but you can define the result as an object of any class derived from ``NumericTable``
          except ``PackedTriangularMatrix``, ``PackedSymmetricMatrix``, and ``CSRNumericTable``.
   * - ``means``
     - *Optional*.

       Pointer to the :math:`1 \times p` numeric table that contains mean values for each feature.

       If the function result is not requested through the ``resultsToCompute`` parameter,
       the numeric table contains a ``NULL`` pointer.
   * - ``variances``
     - *Optional*.

       Pointer to the :math:`1 \times p` numeric table that contains variance values for each feature.

       If the function result is not requested through the ``resultsToCompute`` parameter,
       the numeric table contains a ``NULL`` pointer.     -

.. note::

  By default, each numeric table specified by the collection elements is an object of the ``HomogenNumericTable`` class.
  You can also define the result as an object of any class derived from ``NumericTable``,
  except for ``PackedSymmetricMatrix``, ``PackedTriangularMatrix``, and ``CSRNumericTable``.
