Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
===========================================================

Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is a data clustering algorithm proposed in [Ester96]_.
It is a density-based clustering non-parametric algorithm: given a set of observations in some space,
it groups together observations that are closely packed together (observations with many nearby neighbors),
marking as outliers observations that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away).

Details
*******

Given the set :math:`X = \{x_1 = (x_{11}, \ldots, x_{1p}), \ldots, x_n = (x_{n1}, \ldots, x_{np})\}`
of :math:`n` :math:`p`-dimensional feature vectors (further referred as observations),
a positive floating-point number ``epsilon`` and a positive integer ``minObservations``,
the problem is to get clustering assignments for each input observation, based on the definitions below [Ester96]_:

.. glossary::

   core observation
      An observation |x| is called core observation if at least ``minObservations``
      input observations (including |x|) are within distance ``epsilon`` from observation |x|;

   directly reachable
      An observation |y| is directly reachable from |x| if |y| is within distance ``epsilon`` from :term:`core observation` |x|.
      Observations are only said to be directly reachable from :term:`core observations <core observation>`.

   reachable
      An observation |y| is reachable from an observation |x| if there is a path :math:`x_1, \ldots, x_m`
      with :math:`x_1 = x` and :math:`x_m = y`, where each :math:`x_{i+1}` is :term:`directly reachable` from :math:`x_i`.
      This implies that all observations on the path must be :term:`core observations <core observation>`, with the possible exception of |y|.

   noise observation
      Noise observations are observations that are :term:`not reachable <reachable>` from any other observation.

   cluster
      Two observations |x| and |y| are considered to be in the same cluster if there is a :term:`core observation` :math:`z`,
      and |x| and |y| are both :term:`reachable` from :math:`z`.

Each cluster gets a unique identifier, an integer number from :math:`0` to :math:`\text{total number of clusters } â€“ 1`.
Each observation is assigned an identifier of the :term:`cluster` it belongs to,
or :math:`-1` if the observation considered to be a :term:`noise observation`.
