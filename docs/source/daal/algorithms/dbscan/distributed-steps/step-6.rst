   * - Parameter
     - Default Valude
     - Description
   * - ``algorithmFPType``
     - ``float``
     - The floating-point type that the algorithm uses for intermediate computations. Can be ``float`` or ``double``.
   * - ``method``
     - ``defaultDense``
     - Available methods for computation of DBSCAN algorithm:

       - ``defaultDense`` â€“ uses brute-force for neighborhood computation

   * - ``blockIndex``
     - Not applicable
     - Unique identifier of block initially passed for computation on the local node.
   * - ``nBlocks``
     - Not applicable
     - The number of blocks initially passed for computation on all nodes.
   * - ``epsilon``
     - Not applicable
     - The maximum distance between observations lying in the same neighborhood.
   * - ``minObservations``
     - Not applicable
     - The number of observations in a neighborhood for an observation to be considered as a :term:`core <core observation>`.
   * - ``memorySavingMode``
     - ``false``
     - If flag is set to false, all neighborhoods will be computed and stored prior to clustering.
       It will require up to :math:`O(|\text{sum of sizes of neighborhoods}|)` of additional memory,
       which in worst case can be :math:`O(|\text{number of observations}|^2)`. However, in general, performance may be better.


In this step, the DBSCAN algorithm accepts the input described below.
Pass the ``Input ID`` as a parameter to the methods that provide input for your algorithm.
For more details, :ref:`algorithms`.

.. list-table:: Algorithm Input for DBSCAN (Distributed Processing, Step 6)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: longtable

   * - Input ID
     - Input
   * - ``partialData``
     - Pointer to the collection of numeric tables with :math:`p` columns and arbitrary number of rows, containing observations to be clustered.

       .. include:: ./../../includes/input_data_collection.rst

   * - ``haloData``
     - Pointer to the collection of numeric tables with :math:`p` columns and arbitrary number of rows, containing halo observations
       for current node computed on :ref:`step 5 <dbscan_step_5>`.

       .. include:: ./../../includes/input_data_collection.rst

   * - ``haloDataIndices``
     - Pointer to the collection of numeric tables with :math:`1` column and arbitrary number of rows,
       containing indices for halo observations for current node computed on :ref:`step 5 <dbscan_step_5>`.

       Size of this collection should be equal to the size of collection for ``haloData``'s ``Input ID``.

       .. include:: ./../../includes/input_data_collection_with_exceptions.rst

   * - ``haloDataBlocks``
     - Pointer to the collection of :math:`1 \times 1` numeric tables containing identifiers of initial block for halo observations
       for current node computed on :ref:`step 5 <dbscan_step_5>`.

       Size of this collection should be equal to the size of collection for ``haloData``'s ``Input ID``.

       .. include:: ./../../includes/input_data_collection_with_exceptions.rst
