In this step, the DBSCAN algorithm has the following parameters:

.. include:: distributed-steps/includes/parameters_blocks.rst

In this step, the DBSCAN algorithm accepts the input described below.
Pass the ``Input ID`` as a parameter to the methods that provide input for your algorithm.
For more details, :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Algorithm Input for DBSCAN (Distributed Processing, Step 2)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input ID
     - Input
   * - ``partialData``
     - Pointer to the collection of numeric tables with :math:`p` columns and arbitrary number of rows, containing observations to be clustered.

       .. include:: ./../../includes/input_data_collection.rst

In this step, the DBSCAN algorithms calculates the partial results described below.
Pass the ``Partial Result ID`` as a parameter to the methods that access the partial result of your algorithm.
For more details, :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Partial Results for DBSCAN (Distributed Processing, Step 2)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Partial Result ID
     - Result
   * - ``boundingBox``
     - Pointer to the :math:`2 \times p` numeric table containing bounding box of input observations:
       first row contains minimum value of each feature, second row contains maximum value of each feature.
