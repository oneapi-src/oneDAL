In this step, the DBSCAN algorithm has the following parameters:

.. include:: distributed-steps/includes/parameters_blocks.rst

In this step, the DBSCAN algorithm accepts the input described below.
Pass the ``Input ID`` as a parameter to the methods that provide input for your algorithm.
For more details, :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Algorithm Input for DBSCAN (Distributed Processing, Step 12)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: longtable

   * - Input ID
     - Input
   * - ``step12InputClusterStructure``
     - Pointer to the numeric table with :math:`4` columns and arbitrary number of rows
       containing information about current clustering state of observations processed on the local node.

       .. include:: ./../../includes/input_numeric_table.rst

   * - ``step12PartialOrders``
     - Pointer to the collection of :math:`n \times 2` numeric tables containing information about observations:
       identifier of initial block and index in initial block.
       This information will be required to reconstruct initial blocks after transferring observations among nodes.

       .. include:: ./../../includes/input_data_collection_with_exceptions.rst

Algorithm Output
++++++++++++++++

In this step, the DBSCAN algorithms calculates the partial results described below.
Pass the ``Partial Result ID`` as a parameter to the methods that access the partial result of your algorithm.
For more details, :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Partial Results for DBSCAN (Distributed Processing, Step 12)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Partial Result ID
     - Result
   * - ``assignmentQueries``
     - Pointer to the collection of ``nBlocks`` numeric tables with :math:`2` columns and arbitrary number of rows
       containing clusters assigning queries that should be processed on each node.

       Numeric tables in the collection are ordered by the identifiers of initial block of nodes.
