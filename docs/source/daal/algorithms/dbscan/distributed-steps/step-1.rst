In this step, the DBSCAN algorithm has the following parameters:

.. include:: distributed-steps/includes/parameters_blocks.rst

In this step, the DBSCAN algorithm accepts the input described below.
Pass the ``Input ID`` as a parameter to the methods that provide input for your algorithm. For more details, :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Algorithm Input for DBSCAN (Distributed Processing, Step 1)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input ID
     - Input
   * - ``step1Data``
     - Pointer to the :math:`n \times p` numeric table with the observations to be clustered.

       .. note:: The input can be an object of any class derived from NumericTable.

Algorithm Output
++++++++++++++++

In this step, the DBSCAN algorithms calculates the partial results described below.
Pass the ``Partial Result ID`` as a parameter to the methods that access the partial result of your algorithm.
For more details, :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Partial Results for DBSCAN (Distributed Processing, Step 1)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Partial Result ID
     - Result
   * - ``partialOrder``
     - Pointer to the :math:`n \times 2` numeric table containing information about observations:
       identifier of initial block and index in initial block.
       This information will be required to reconstruct initial blocks after transferring observations among nodes.
