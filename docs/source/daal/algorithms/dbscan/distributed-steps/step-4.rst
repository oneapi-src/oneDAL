In this step, the DBSCAN algorithm has the following parameters:

.. include:: distributed-steps/includes/parameters_blocks_left_right.rst

In this step, the DBSCAN algorithm accepts the input described below.
Pass the ``Input ID`` as a parameter to the methods that provide input for your algorithm.
For more details, :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Algorithm Input for DBSCAN (Distributed Processing, Step 4)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input ID
     - Input
   * - ``partialData``
     - Pointer to the collection of numeric tables with :math:`p` columns and arbitrary number of rows, containing observations to be clustered.

       .. include:: ./../../includes/input_data_collection.rst

   * - ``step4PartialOrders``
     - Pointer to the collection of numeric table with :math:`2` columns and arbitrary number of rows containing information about observations:
       identifier of initial block and index in initial block.

       .. include:: ./../../includes/input_data_collection_with_exceptions.rst

   * - ``step4PartialSplits``
     - Pointer to the collection of the :math:`1 \times 2` numeric table containing information about split computed on
       :ref:`step 3 <dbscan_step_3>` and collected from all nodes
       participating in current iteration of geometric repartitioning process.

Algorithm Output
++++++++++++++++

In this step, the DBSCAN algorithms calculates the partial results described below.
Pass the ``Partial Result ID`` as a parameter to the methods that access the partial result of your algorithm.
For more details, :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Partial Results for DBSCAN (Distributed Processing, Step 4)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Partial Result ID
     - Result
   * - ``partitionedData``
     - Pointer to the collection of (``leftBlocks`` + ``rightBlocks``) numeric tables with :math:`p` columns and arbitrary number of rows
       containing observations for processing on nodes participating in current iteration of geometric repartitioning.

       - First ``leftBlocks`` numeric tables in collection have the value of selected split feature smaller than selected split value.
       - Next ``rightBlocks`` numeric tables in collection have the value of selected split feature larger than selected split value.
