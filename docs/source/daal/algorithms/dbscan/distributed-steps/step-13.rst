In this step, the DBSCAN algorithm has the following parameters:

.. include:: distributed-steps/includes/parameters.rst

In this step, the DBSCAN algorithm accepts the input described below.
Pass the ``Input ID`` as a parameter to the methods that provide input for your algorithm.
For more details, :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Algorithm Input for DBSCAN (Distributed Processing, Step 13)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input ID
     - Input
   * - ``partialAssignmentQueries``
     - Pointer to the collection of numeric tables with :math:`2` columns and arbitrary number of rows
       containing clusters assigning queries that should be processed on the local node collected from all nodes.

       .. include:: ./../../includes/input_data_collection_with_exceptions.rst

Algorithm Output
++++++++++++++++

In this step, the DBSCAN algorithms calculates the results and partial results described below.
Pass the ``Result ID`` as a parameter to the methods that access the result and partial result of your algorithm.

   * - Result ID
     - Result
   * - ``step13Assignments``
     - Pointer to the :math:`n \times 1` numeric table with assignments of cluster indices to observations
       processed on :ref:`step 1 <dbscan_step_1>` on the local node.
       :term:`Noise observations <noise observation>` have the assignment equal to :math:`-1`.
