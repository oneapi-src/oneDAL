Logistic Regression
===================

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 4


Logistic regression is a method for modeling the relationships
between one or more explanatory variables and a categorical variable
by expressing the posterior statistical distribution of the
categorical variable via linear functions on observed data. If the
categorical variable is binary, taking only two values, "0" and "1",
the logistic regression is simple, otherwise, it is multinomial.


Details
*******

Given n feature vectors of n p-dimensional feature vectors a vector
of class labels :math:`y = (y_1,\ldots{},y_n )`, where :math:`y_i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, K-1\}` and :math:`K` is the number of classes, describes the
class to which the feature vector :math:`x_i` belongs, the problem is to
train a logistic regression model.

The logistic regression model is the set of vectors :math:`\beta =\left\{ {\beta }_{0}=\left({\beta }_{00}\dots {\beta }_{0p}\right), {..\beta }_{K-1}=\left({\beta }_{K-10}\dots {\beta }_{K-1p}\right)\right\}` that gives the posterior probability

.. math::
   {P\left\{y=k|x\right\}= p}_{k}\left(x, \beta \right)=\mathrm{ }\frac{{e}^{{f}_{k}\left(x, \beta \right)}}{\sum _{i=0}^{K-1}{e}^{{f}_{i}\left(x, \beta \right)}}, \text{where} {f}_{k}\left(x, \beta \right)= {\beta }_{k0}+ \sum _{j=1}^{p}{\beta }_{kj}*{x}_{j}

for a given feature vector :math:`x = (x_1, \ldots, x_p)` and class
label :math:`y \in \{0, 1, \ldots, K - 1\}` for each :math:`k = 0, \ldots, K-1`. See [Hastie2009]_.

If the categorical variable is binary, the model is defined as a single vector :math:`{\beta }_{0}=\left({\beta }_{00}\dots {\beta }_{0p}\right)` that determines the posterior probability

.. math::

		 P\left\{y=1|x\right\}= \mathrm{\sigma }\left(x,\mathrm{ }\mathrm{\beta }\right)=\frac{1}{1+ {e}^{-f\left(x, \beta \right)}}

		 P\left\{y=0|x\right\}=1- P\left\{y=1|x\right\}


Training Stage
--------------

Training procedure is an iterative algorithm which minimizes
objective function

.. math::
		 L\left(\beta \right)=-\frac{1}{n}\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathrm{log}{p}_{{y}_{i}}\left({x}_{i},\mathrm{ }\mathrm{\beta }\right)+\mathrm{ }{\lambda }_{1}\sum _{k=0}^{K-1}{\|{\beta }_{k}\|}_{L1}+ {\lambda }_{2}\sum _{k=0}^{K-1}{\|{\beta }_{k}\|}_{L2}

where the first term is the negative log-likelihood of conditional
:math:`Y` given :math:`X`, and the latter terms are regularization ones that
penalize the complexity of the model (large :math:`\beta` values), :math:`\lambda_1` and :math:`\lambda_2` are non-negative regularization
parameters applied to L1 and L2 norm of vectors in :math:`\beta`.

For more details, see [Hastie2009]_, [Bishop2006]_.

For the objective function minimization the library supports the
iterative algorithms defined by the interface of
|namespace|::algorithms::iterative_solver. See :ref:`iterative_solver`.

Prediction Stage
-----------------

Given logistic regression model and vectors :math:`x_1, \ldots, x_r`, the problem is to calculate the responses for those
vectors, and their probabilities and logarithms of probabilities
if required. The computation is based on formula (1) in
multinomial case and on formula (2) in binary case.

Usage of Training Alternative
*****************************

To build a Logistic Regression model using methods of the Model Builder class of Logistic Regression,
complete the following steps:

- Create a Logistic Regression model builder using a constructor with the required number of responses and features.
- Use the ``setBeta`` method to add the set of pre-calculated coefficients to the model.
  Specify random access iterators to the first and the last element of the set of coefficients [ISO/IEC 14882:2011 §24.2.7]_.

  .. note::

    If your set of coefficients does not contain an intercept, interceptFlag is automatically set to ``False``, and to ``True``, otherwise.

- Use the ``getModel`` method to get the trained Logistic Regression model.
- Use the ``getStatus`` method to check the status of the model building process.
  If ``DAAL_NOTHROW_EXCEPTIONS`` macros is defined, the status report contains the list of errors
  that describe the problems API encountered (in case of API runtime failure).

.. note::

  If after calling the ``getModel`` method you use the ``setBeta`` method to update coefficients,
  the initial model will be automatically updated with the new :math:`\beta` coefficients.

.. note::

   Note that:

   - If `resultsToCompute` does not contain `computeClassesLabels`, the `prediction` table is `NULL`.

   - If `resultsToCompute` does not contain `computeClassesProbabilities`, the `probabilities` table is `NULL`.

   - If `resultsToCompute` does not contain `computeClassesLogProbabilities`, the `logProbabilities` table is `NULL`.

   -  By default, each numeric table of this result is an object of
      the ``HomogenNumericTable`` class, but you can define the result as
      an object of any class derived from ``NumericTable`` except for
      ``PackedSymmetricMatrix`` and ``PackedTriangularMatrix``.
