|full_name| (|short_name|)
------------------------------------------------------

|full_name| (|short_name|) is a library
that helps speed up big data analysis by providing highly optimized
algorithmic building blocks for all stages of data analytics
(preprocessing, transformation, analysis, modeling, validation, and
decision making) in batch, online, and distributed processing modes of
computation. The library provides two different sets of C++ interfaces: :ref:`oneAPI and DAAL <oneapi_vs_daal>`.

For general information, refer to |onedal-landing|_.

.. _oneapi_vs_daal:

oneAPI vs. DAAL Interfaces
==========================

- :ref:`oneapi_dal_guide` are based on open |spec|_ and are currently under an active development.
  They work on various hardware but only a limited set of algorithms is available at the moment.

- :ref:`daal_guide` are CPU-only interfaces that provide implementations for a wide range of algorithms.
