DLL file not found
******************

If you run your program in Visual Studio and encounter a "sycl.dll was not found" runtime error
or a similar one such as the one shown below, update the project property :guilabel:`Debugging` > :guilabel:`Environment`. 
To do this, follow `How to Fix`_ instructions.

    :alt: Unable to start a program: the code execution cannot proceed because XXX.dll was not found. 
    :class: with-border

.. attention::

  The issue appears as the result of how Visual Studio 2017 and its later versions
  handle additional directories for the ``PATH`` environment variable.

How to Fix
----------

1. Open the project's properties, go to :guilabel:`Debugging` > :guilabel:`Environment` property, 
   right-click the drop-down menu, and select :guilabel:`Edit`:

    :class: with-border

2. Copy the default value of the ``PATH`` environment variable from the :guilabel:`Evaluated value`
   section and then paste it to the section above it:

3. Add to ``PATH`` the paths to the dll files that the program needs:
