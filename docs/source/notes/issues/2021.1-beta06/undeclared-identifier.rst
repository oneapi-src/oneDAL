Undeclared identifier ``CL_DEVICE_IL_VERSION_KHR``
**************************************************

When you build an application with |short_name|, you might encounter the following problem:

.. code-block:: text

    error: use of undeclared identifier CL_DEVICE_IL_VERSION_KHR

This is caused by a bug in |dpcpp| 2021.1-beta06 release.

How to fix
----------

The workaround for this issue is to set ``CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH`` as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="$DPCPP_ROOT/compiler/latest/linux/include/sycl"
