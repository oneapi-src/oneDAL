oneAPI examples failing with segfault
*************************************

oneAPI examples located in the ``examples/oneapi`` directory are failing with a segmentation fault (segfault).
This happens because the directory that contains data is skipped during installation.

How to Fix
----------

The workaround is to copy the missing directory from the source repository:

#. Copy the `missing data directory <https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDAL/tree/rls/onedal-beta09-rls/examples/oneapi/data>`_ from |short_name| repository.

#. Place the ``data`` directory within the ``examples/oneapi`` directory on your machine.
