PCA examples failing on GPU devices
***********************************

Prinical Component Analysis (PCA) examples are failing on GPU devices but work on CPU-only systems.

.. code-block:: text

    terminate called after throwing an instance of 'oneapi::dal::internal_error'
    what():  Result eigenvalues should not be empty

How to Fix
----------

There is no workaround available.

You can evaluate examples located in the ``examples/daal/cpp_sycl`` directory.
They provide oneAPI support and work on both CPU and GPU devices.
