K-Means initialization
======================

------------------------
Mathematical formulation
------------------------

.. _kmeans_init_c_math:

Computing
---------

Given the training set :math:`X = \{ x_1, \ldots, x_n \}` of
:math:`p`-dimensional feature vectors and a positive integer :math:`k`, the
problem is to find a set :math:`C = \{ c_1, \ldots, c_k \}` of
:math:`p`-dimensional initial centroids.

.. _kmeans_init_c_math_dense:

Computing method: *dense*
-------------------------

The method chooses first :math:`k` feature vectors from the training set
:math:`X`.

.. _kmeans_init_c_math_random_dense:

Computing method: *random_dense*
--------------------------------

The method chooses random :math:`k` feature vectors from the training set
:math:`X`.

.. _kmeans_init_c_math_plus_plus_dense:

Computing method: *plus_plus_dense* (only on CPU)
-------------------------------------------------

The method is designed as follows: the first centroid :math:`c_0` is selected randomly and :math:`C = \{ c_1 \}`.
Then the following step is repeated until :math:`C` reaches the necessary size.

.. math::
   c_{i+1} = \mathrm{arg}\max_{x \in X} d^2(x, C), C = C \cup \{ c_{i+1} \}

.. _kmeans_init_c_math_parallel_plus_dense:

Computing method: *parallel_plus_dense* (only on CPU)
-----------------------------------------------------

The method is the same as :ref:`K-Means++ <kmeans_init_c_math_plus_plus_dense>`, but the data is divided into equal parts and the
algorithm runs on each of them.

---------------------
Programming Interface
---------------------

Refer to :ref:`API Reference: K-Means initialization <api_kmeans_init>`.
