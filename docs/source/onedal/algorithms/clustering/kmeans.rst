Training
--------
Given the training set :math:`X = \{ x_1, \ldots, x_n \}` of
:math:`p`-dimensional feature vectors and a positive integer :math:`k`, the
problem is to find a set :math:`C = \{ c_1, \ldots, c_k \}` of
:math:`p`-dimensional centroids that minimize the objective function

.. math::
   \Phi_{X}(C) = \sum_{i = 1}^n d^2(x_i, C),

where :math:`d^2(x_i, C)` is the squared Euclidean distance from :math:`x_i` to
the closest centroid in :math:`C`,

.. math::
   d^2(x_i, C) = \min_{1 \leq j \leq k} \| x_i - c_j \|^2, \quad 1 \leq i \leq n.

Expression :math:`\|\cdot\|` denotes :math:`L_2` `norm
<https://mathworld.wolfram.com/L2-Norm.html>`_.

.. note::
   In the general case, :math:`d` may be an arbitrary distance function. Current
   version of the oneDAL spec defines only Euclidean distance case.

Training method: *Lloyd's*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Lloyd's method [Lloyd82]_ consists in iterative updates of centroids by
applying the alternating *Assignment* and *Update* steps, where :math:`t`
denotes a index of the current iteration, e.g., :math:`C^{(t)} = \{ c_1^{(t)},
\ldots, c_k^{(t)} \}` is the set of centroids at the :math:`t`-th iteration. The
method requires the initial centroids :math:`C^{(1)}` to be specified at the
beginning of the algorithm (:math:`t = 1`).

**(1) Assignment step:** Assign each feature vector :math:`x_i` to the nearest
centroid. :math:`y_i^{(t)}` denotes the assigned label (cluster index) to the
feature vector :math:`x_i`.

.. math::
   y_i^{(t)} = \mathrm{arg}\min_{1 \leq j \leq k} \| x_i - c_j^{(t)} \|^2, \quad 1 \leq i \leq n.

Each feature vector from the training set :math:`X` is assigned to exactly one
centroid so that :math:`X` is partitioned to :math:`k` disjoint sets (clusters)

.. math::
   S_j^{(t)} = \big\{ \; x_i \in X : \; y_i^{(t)} = j \; \big\}, \quad 1 \leq j \leq k.

**(2) Update step:** Recalculate centroids by averaging feature vectors assigned
to each cluster.

.. math::
   c_j^{(t + 1)} = \frac{1}{|S_j^{(t)}|} \sum_{x \in S_j^{(t)}} x, \quad 1 \leq j \leq k.

If any of :math:`S_j^{(t)}` are empty, start the empty clusters handling procedure.
In this case, you can set the value of :math:`c_j^{(t+1)}` as the farthest point from
the previously calculated centroids for each empty cluster. This procedure makes sure
that the number of clusters remains the same.

.. math::
   c_j^{(t + 1)} = \mathrm{arg}\max_{x \in X} d^2(x, C^{(t + 1)}).

The steps (1) and (2) are performed until the following **stop condition**,

.. math::
   \Phi_{X}(C^{(t)}) -  \Phi_{X}(C^{(t + 1)}) < \varepsilon,

is satisfied or number of iterations exceeds the maximal value :math:`T` defined
by the user.


.. _kmeans_i_math:

Inference
---------
Given the inference set :math:`X' = \{ x_1', \ldots, x_m' \}` of
:math:`p`-dimensional feature vectors and the set :math:`C = \{ c_1, \ldots, c_k
\}` of centroids produced at the training stage, the problem is to predict the
index :math:`y_j' \in \{ 0, \ldots, k-1 \}`, :math:`1 \leq j \leq m`, of the
centroid in accordance with a method-defined rule.

.. _kmeans_i_math_lloyd:

Inference method: *Lloyd's*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lloyd's inference method computes the :math:`y_j'` as an index of the centroid
closest to the feature vector :math:`x_j'`,

.. math::
   y_j' = \mathrm{arg}\min_{1 \leq l \leq k} \| x_j' - c_l \|^2, \quad 1 \leq j \leq m.
