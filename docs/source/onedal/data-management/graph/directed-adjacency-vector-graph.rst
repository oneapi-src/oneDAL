===============================
Directed adjacency vector graph
===============================

Class ``directed_adjacency_vector_graph`` is the implementation of
:capterm:`directed <Directed graph>` :capterm:`weighted <Weighted graph>` sparse
graph concept with :capterm:`adjacency matrix` underneath for which the following is true:

- The data within the graph is sparse and stored in :capterm:`CSR format <CSR data>`.
- The :ref:`specific graph traits <api_graph_traits>` are defined for this class.
