This section describes the types related to the :txtref:`graph` concept.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 70

   * - Type
     - Description

   * - :ref:`api_graphs_data_layout`
     - An enumeration of :capterm:`data layouts<data layout>` used to store
       :capterm:`adjacency matrix` inside the :capterm:`graph`.

---------------------------
Requirements on graph types
---------------------------

Each implementation of :txtref:`graph` concept:

1. Follows the definition of the :txtref:`graph` concept and its restrictions
   (e.g., :capterm:`immutability`).

2. Is :term:`reference-counted <Reference-counted object>`.

3. :txtref:`graph_traits` should be defined for each new :txtref:`graph` type.

The following listing provides an example of graph API to illustrate table kinds
and copy-assignment operation:

   * - Graph type
     - Description

   * - :txtref:`undirected_adjacency_vector_graph`
     - A sparse undirected weighted or unweighted graph that contains :term:`CSR <CSR data>`
       data format.

   * - :txtref:`directed_adjacency_vector_graph`
     - A sparse directed weighted or unweighted graph that contains :term:`CSR <CSR data>`
       data format.
