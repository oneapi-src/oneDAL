Accessors
=========

This section defines :txtref:`requirements <accessor_reqs>` to an
:txtref:`accessor` implementation and introduces several
:txtref:`accessor_types`.

.. _accessor_reqs:

------------
Requirements
------------

Each accessor implementation:

#. Defines a single :term:`format of the data <Data format>` for the
   access. Every accessor type returns and use only one data format.

#. Provides read-only access to the data in the :txtref:`table` types.

#. Provides the :code:`pull()` method for obtaining the values from the table.

#. Is lightweight. Its constructors do not have computationally intensive
   operations such data copy, reading, or conversion. These operations are
   performed by method :code:`pull()`.

#. The :code:`pull()` method avoids data copy and conversion when it is
   possible to return the pointer to the memory block in the table. This is
   applicable for cases such as when the :capterm:`data format` and
   :capterm:`data types <data type>` of the data within the table are the same as the
   :capterm:`data format` and :capterm:`data type` for the access.


.. _accessor_types:

Accessor Types
--------------

|short_name| defines a set of accessor classes. Each class supports one
specific way of obtaining data from the :txtref:`table`.

All accessor classes in |short_name| are listed below:

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.25}|\Y{0.5}|\Y{0.25}|

.. list-table:: Accessor Types
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 50 25
   :class: longtable

   * - Accessor type
     - Description
     - List of supported types
   * - :txtref:`row_accessor`
     - Provides access to the range of rows as one :term:`contiguous
       <Contiguous data>` :term:`homogeneous <Homogeneous data>` block of memory.
     - :txtref:`homogen_table`
   * - :txtref:`column_accessor`
     - Provides access to the range of values within a single column as one
       :term:`contiguous <Contiguous data>` :term:`homogeneous <Homogeneous
       data>` block of memory.
     - :txtref:`homogen_table`
