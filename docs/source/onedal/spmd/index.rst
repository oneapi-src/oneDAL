Single Program Multiple Data
============================

This section includes concepts and descriptions of objects that support 
distributed computations using :capterm:`SPMD` model.

Distributed computation using SPMD model
----------------------------------------

In a typical usage scenario, a user provides a :capterm:`communicator` object as a first parameter of 
a free function to indicate that the algorithm can process data simultaneously. All internal inter-process 
communications at sync points are hidden from the user.

General expectation is that input dataset is distributed among processes. Results are distributed in
accordance with the input.

.. _communicator_operations:

Supported Collective Operations
-------------------------------

The following collective operations are supported:

- ``bcast``
  Broadcasts data from specified process.

- ``allreduce``
  Reduces data among all processes.

- ``allgatherv``
  Gathers data from all processes and shares the result among all processes.

- ``sendrecv_replace``
  Sends and receives data using a single buffer.

.. _backend_restrictions:

Backend-specific restrictions
-----------------------------

- oneCCL:
  Allgetherv does not support arbitrary displacements. The result is expected to
  be closely packed without gaps.

- oneMPI:
  Collective operations in oneMPI do not support asynchronous executions. They block the
  process till completion.
