Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is a data clustering algorithm proposed in [Ester96]_.
It is a density-based clustering non-parametric algorithm: given a set of observations in some space,
it groups together observations that are closely packed together (observations with many nearby neighbors),
marking as outliers observations that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away).
