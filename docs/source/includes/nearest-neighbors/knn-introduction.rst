:math:`k`-NN :capterm:`classification` and :capterm:`search` algorithms are based on finding
the :math:`k` nearest observations to the training set. For :capterm:`classification`,
the problem is to infer the class of a new feature vector by computing the majority vote of its
:math:`k` nearest observations from the training set.
For :capterm:`search`, the problem is to infer :math:`k` nearest observations from
the training set to a new feature vector. The nearest observations are computed
based on the chosen distance metric.
