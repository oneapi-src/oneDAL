==================
Backend Primitives
==================

Refer to :ref:`Developer Guide: Backend Primitives <dm_backend_primitives>`.

.. _backend_primitives_programming_interface:

---------------------
Programming interface
---------------------

All types and functions in this section are declared in the
``oneapi::dal::backend::primitives`` namespace and be available via inclusion of the
``oneapi/dal/backend/primitives/ndarray.hpp`` header file.

.. _api_dm_ndorder:

Multidimensional array order
----------------------------

Refers to data indexing order, or how a linear sequence is translated into a multi-dimensional array.

.. onedal_enumclass:: oneapi::dal::backend::primitives::ndorder

.. _api_dm_ndshape:

Multidimensional array shape
----------------------------

.. onedal_class:: oneapi::dal::backend::primitives::ndshape

Multidimensional data view (ndview)
-----------------------------------

An implementation of a multidimensional data container that provides a view of the homogeneous
data stored in an externally-managed memory block.

All the ``ndview`` class methods can be divided into several groups:

#. The group of ``wrap()`` methods that are used to create an ``ndview`` object from external,
   mutable or immutable memory.

#. The group of ``wrap_mutable()`` methods that are used to create a mutable ``ndview`` object from
   ``dal::array`` object.

#. The methods that are used to access the data.

#. The methods like ``t()`` and ``reshape()`` that are used to change the shape and layout of the data view.

#. The group of data slicing methods that are used to create a new ``ndview`` object that is a
   view of the original data slice along some dimension.

#. The group of data transfering methods that are used to produce a new ``ndview`` object that
   contains the data copied from the original one, but at the different memory location.

Multidimensional array (ndarray)
--------------------------------

An implementation of multidimensional data array that provides a way to store and manipulate
homogeneous data in a multidimensional structure.

All the ``ndarray`` class methods can be divided into several groups:

#. The group of ``wrap()`` and ``wrap_mutable()`` methods that are used to create an ``ndarray``
   object from external, mutable or immutable memory.

#. The group of ``wrap()`` and ``wrap_mutable()`` methods that are used to create an ``ndarray``
   that shares its data with another data object.

#. The group of methods like ``zeros()``, ``full()``, ``arange()``, etc. that are used to create an ``ndarray``
   object with the specified shape and values.

#. The methods like ``t()`` and ``reshape()`` that are used to change the shape and layout
   of the multidimensional array.

#. The group of data slicing methods that are used to create a new ``ndarray`` object that is a view
   of the original data slice along some dimension.

#. The group of methods like ``fill()``, ``assign()``, ``assign_from_host()``, etc. that are used to
   fill the array with the specified values.
