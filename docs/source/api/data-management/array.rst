Array

Refer to :ref:`Developer Guide: Array <dm_array>`.

---------------------
Programming interface
---------------------

All types and functions in this section are declared in the
``oneapi::dal`` namespace and be available via inclusion of the
``oneapi/dal/array.hpp`` header file.

All the ``array`` class methods can be divided into several groups:

1. Constructors that are used to create an array from external, mutable or
   immutable memory.

2. Constructors and assignment operators that are used to create an array that shares its data
   with another one.

3. The group of ``reset()`` methods that are used to re-assign an array to another external
   memory block.

4. The group of ``reset()`` methods that are used to re-assign an array to an internally
   allocated memory block.

5. The methods that are used to access the data.

6. Static methods that provide simplified ways to create an array either from external
   memory or by allocating it within a new object.
