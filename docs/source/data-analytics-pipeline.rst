Data Analytics Pipeline
***********************

|full_name| (|short_name|) is a library that provides building
blocks covering all stages of data analytics: data acquisition from a
data source, preprocessing, transformation, data mining, modeling,
validation, and decision making.

|short_name| supports the concept of the end-to-end analytics when
some of data analytics stages are performed on the edge devices (close
to where the data is generated and where it is finally
consumed). Specifically, |short_name| Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs) are agnostic about a particular cross-device
communication technology and, therefore, can be used within different
end-to-end analytics frameworks.
