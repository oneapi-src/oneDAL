======================
Distributed SPMD model
======================

Refer to :ref:`Developer Guide: SPMD <dg_spmd>`.

---------------------
Programming interface
---------------------

All types and functions in this section are declared in the
``oneapi::dal::spmd::preview`` namespace and are available via inclusion of the
header file from specified backend.

:term:`SPMD` distributed model consists of the following components:

1. Additional ``train``, ``infer``, and ``compute`` methods that accept ``communicator`` object
   as the first parameter. Those methods are expected to be called on all ranks to start
   distributed simulations.

2. The :term:`communicator` class that contains methods to perform collective operations among all ranks.

3. Free functions to create a :term:`communicator` using a specified :term:`communicator backend`. Available backends are ``ccl``
   and ``mpi``.

Usage Example
-------------

The following listings provide a brief introduction on how to create a particular communicator.
