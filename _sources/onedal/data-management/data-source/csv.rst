---------------
CSV data source
---------------
Class ``csv::data_source`` is an API for accessing the data source represented
as a :term:`csv file <CSV file>`. CSV data source is used with
:cpp:expr:`read` operation to extract data in text format from the given input file,
process it using provided parameters (such as delimiter and read options),
transform it into numerical representation, and store it as an in-memory
:txtref:`dataset` of a chosen type.

Supported type of in-memory object for :cpp:expr:`read` operation with CSV data
source is :cpp:expr:`oneapi::dal::table`.

CSV data source requires input file name to be set in the constructor, while the
other parameters of the constructor such as delimiter and read options rely on
default values.
