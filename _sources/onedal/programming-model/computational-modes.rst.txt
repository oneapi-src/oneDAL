Computational Modes
===================

.. _batch:

-----
Batch
-----
In the batch processing mode, the algorithm works with the entire data set to produce the final
result. A more complex scenario occurs when the entire data set is not available at the moment
or the data set does not fit into the device memory.

.. _online:

------
Online
------
In the online processing mode, the algorithm processes a data set in blocks streamed into the
device's memory. Partial results are updated incrementally and finalized when the last data block
is processed.

.. _distributed:

-----------
Distributed
-----------
In the distributed processing mode, the algorithm operates on a data set
distributed across several devices (compute nodes). On each node, the algorithm
produces partial results that are later merged into the final result on the main
node.
