CPU and GPU Support
===================
Not all computation modes, methods, and parameters are supported on both CPU and GPU.
See the differences in CPU and GPU support below.

GPU-Supported Targets
*********************
OneDAL is designed to work with Intel(R) GPUs specifically, but it could potentially 
run on other hardware platforms if a SYCL runtime is available.
