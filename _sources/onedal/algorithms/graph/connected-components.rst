Computing
---------

Given an :capterm:`undirected graph<Undirected graph>` :math:`G`, the problem is to find :capterm:`connected components<Component>` in :math:`G`, 
determine their quantity, and label vertices so that vertices from the same component have the same label.

.. rubric:: Example

.. figure:: images/connected-components.png
    :width: 600
    :align: center
    :alt:
 
Сomponents are labeled from :math:`0` to :math:`k-1`, where :math:`k` is the number of components.
For the example above, the labels for vertices are [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4].

This notation means that:

* vertices with ids 0 and 5 belong to the connected component with id 0 
* vertices with ids 1, 2, 3, and 6 belong to the connected component with id 1 
* vertex with id 4 belongs to the connected component with id 2 
* vertex with id 7 belongs to the connected component with id 3 
* vertices with ids 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 belong to the connected component with id 4 

.. _connected_components_afforest:

Computation method: *afforest*
------------------------------
The method defines Afforest algorithm and solves the problem of сonnected components identification in an undirected graph.

This algorithm expands the Shiloach-Vishkin connected components algorithm and uses component approximation to decrease redundant edge processing. The method consists of the following steps:

#. Process a fixed number of edges for each vertex (Vertex Neighbor Sampling optimization).
#. Identify the largest intermediate component using probabilistic method.
#. Process the rest of the neighborhoods only for the vertices that do not belong to the largest component (Large Component Skipping optimization).
