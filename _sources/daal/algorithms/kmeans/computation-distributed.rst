.. important::
    The algorithm computes assignments using input centroids.
    Therefore, to compute assignments using final computed centroids, after the last call to ``Step2compute()`` method on the master node,
    on each local node set assignFlag to true and do one additional call to ``Step1compute()`` and ``finalizeCompute()`` methods.
    Always set assignFlag to true and call ``finalizeCompute()`` to obtain assignments in each step.

.. note::
    To compute assignments using original ``inputCentroids`` on the given node,
    you can use K-Means clustering algorithm in the batch processing mode with the subset of the data available on this node.
    See :ref:`kmeans_computation_batch` for more details.
