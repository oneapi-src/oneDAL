Classification Gradient Boosted Trees
=====================================

Gradient boosted trees classification is the special case of gradient
boosted trees. For more details, see Gradient Boosted Trees.

Details
*******

Given n feature vectors :math:`X = \{x_1 = (x_{11}, \ldots, x_{1p}), \ldots, x_n = (x_{n1}, \ldots, x_{np}) \}` of n
p-dimensional feature vectors and a vector of class labels :math:`y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n)`, where
:math:`y_i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, C-1\}` and
C is the number of classes, which describes the class to which the
feature vector :math:`x_i` belongs, the problem is to build a gradient
boosted trees classifier.

Training Stage
--------------

Gradient boosted trees classification follows the algorithmic
framework of gradient boosted trees training. For a classification
problem with K classes, K regression trees are constructed on each
iteration, one for each output class. The loss function is
cross-entropy (multinomial deviance):

.. math::
	L(y,f) = -\sum_{k=1}^{K}(I(y=k)\ln{p_{k}(x)})

where :math:`{p}_{k}(x)=\mathrm{ }\frac{{e}^{{f}_{k}\left(x\right)}}{\sum _{i=1}^{K}{e}^{{f}_{i}\left(x\right)}}`

Binary classification is a special case when single regression tree is trained on each iteration. The loss function is

.. math::
	L(y,f) = -(y\cdot \ln{\sigma(f)} + (1-y)\ln(1- \sigma(f)))

where :math:`\sigma(f)=\frac{1}{1+ {e}^{-f}}`

Prediction Stage
----------------

Given the gradient boosted trees classifier model and vectors :math:`(x_1, \ldots, x_r)`, the problem is to calculate labels for
those vectors. To solve the problem for each given feature vector
:math:`x_i`, the algorithm finds the leaf node in a tree in the
ensemble, and the leaf node gives the tree response. The algorithm
computes a sum of responses of all the trees for each class and
chooses the label y corresponding to the class with the maximal
response value (highest class probability).

Usage of Training Alternative
*****************************

To build a Gradient Boosted Trees Classification model using methods of the Model Builder class of Gradient Boosted Tree Classification,
complete the following steps:

- Create a Gradient Boosted Tree Classification model builder using a constructor with the required number of classes and trees.
- Create a decision tree and add nodes to it:

  - Use the ``createTree`` method with the required number of nodes in a tree and a label of the class for which the tree is created.
  - Use the ``addSplitNode`` and addLeafNode methods to add split and leaf nodes to the created tree.
    See the note below describing the decision tree structure.
  - After you add all nodes to the current tree, proceed to creating the next one in the same way.

- Use the ``getModel`` method to get the trained Gradient Boosted Trees Classification model after all trees have been created.

.. note::

  Each tree consists of internal nodes (called non-leaf or split nodes) and external nodes (leaf nodes).
  Each split node denotes a feature test that is a Boolean expression, for example,
  f < ``featureValue`` or f = ``featureValue``, where f is a feature and ``featureValue`` is a constant.
  The test type depends on the feature type: continuous, categorical, or ordinal.
  For more information on the test types, see :ref:`decision_tree`.

  The inducted decision tree is a binary tree, meaning that each non-leaf node has exactly two branches: true and false.
  Each split node contains featureIndex, the index of the feature used for the feature test in this node,
  and ``featureValue``, the constant for the Boolean expression in the test.
  Each leaf node contains a classLabel, the predicted class for this leaf.
  For more information on decision trees, see :ref:`decision_tree`.

  Add nodes to the created tree in accordance with the pre-calculated structure of the tree.
  Check that the leaf nodes do not have children nodes and that the splits have exactly two children.
