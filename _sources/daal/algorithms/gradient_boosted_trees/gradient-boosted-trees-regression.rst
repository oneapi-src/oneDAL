Regression Gradient Boosted Trees
=================================

Gradient boosted trees regression is the special case of gradient
boosted trees. For more details, see :ref:`gb_trees`.

Details
*******

Given n feature vectors :math:`X = \{x_1 = (x_{11}, \ldots, x_{1p}), \ldots, x_n = (x_{n1}, \ldots, x_{np}) \}` of :math:`n`
:math:`p`-dimensional feature vectors and a vector of dependent variables :math:`y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n)`, the problem is to build a gradient
boosted trees regression model that minimizes the loss function based
on the predicted and true value.

Training Stage
--------------

Gradient boosted trees regression follows the algorithmic
framework of gradient boosted trees training with following loss

.. math::
	L(y,Â f)=\frac{1}{2}({y-f(x))}^{2}

Prediction Stage
----------------

Given the gradient boosted trees regression model and vectors :math:`(x_1, \ldots, x_r)`, the problem is to calculate responses
for those vectors. To solve the problem for each given feature
vector :math:`x_i`, the algorithm finds the leaf node in a tree in
the ensemble, and the leaf node gives the tree response. The
algorithm result is a sum of responses of all the trees.

Usage of Training Alternative
*****************************

To build a Gradient Boosted Trees Regression model using methods of the Model Builder class
of Gradient Boosted Tree Regression, complete the following steps:

- Create a Gradient Boosted Tree Regression model builder using a constructor with the required number of classes and trees.
- Create a decision tree and add nodes to it:

  - Use the ``createTree`` method with the required number of nodes in a tree and a label of the class for which the tree is created.
  - Use the ``addSplitNode`` and ``addLeafNode`` methods to add split and leaf nodes to the created tree.
    See the note below describing the decision tree structure.
  - After you add all nodes to the current tree, proceed to creating the next one in the same way.

- Use the ``getModel`` method to get the trained Gradient Boosted Trees Regression model after all trees have been created.

.. note::

  Each tree consists of internal nodes (called non-leaf or split nodes) and external nodes (leaf nodes).
  Each split node denotes a feature test that is a Boolean expression, for example,
  f < ``featureValue`` or f = ``featureValue``, where f is a feature and ``featureValue`` is a constant.
  The test type depends on the feature type: continuous, categorical, or ordinal.
  For more information on the test types, see :ref:`decision_tree`.

  The inducted decision tree is a binary tree, meaning that each non-leaf node has exactly two branches: true and false.
  Each split node contains ``featureIndex``, the index of the feature used for the feature test in this node, and ``featureValue``,
  the constant for the Boolean expression in the test. Each leaf node contains a ``classLabel``, the predicted class for this leaf.
  For more information on decision trees, see :ref:`decision_tree`.

  Add nodes to the created tree in accordance with the pre-calculated structure of the tree.
  Check that the leaf nodes do not have children nodes and that the splits have exactly two children.

Batch Processing
****************

Gradient boosted trees regression follows the general workflow
described in :ref:`gb_trees` and :ref:`regression_usage_model`.

Training
--------

In addition to parameters of the gradient boosted trees described in :ref:`gb_trees_batch`,
the gradient boosted trees regression training algorithm has the
following parameters:

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.15}|\Y{0.15}|\Y{0.7}|

.. list-table:: Training Parameters for Gradient Boosted Trees Regression (Batch Processing)
   :widths: 10 10 60
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left
   :class: longtable

   * - Parameter
     - Default Value
     - Description
   * - ``algorithmFPType``
     - ``float``
     - The floating-point type that the algorithm uses for intermediate computations. Can be ``float`` or ``double``.
   * - ``method``
     - ``defaultDense``
     - The computation method used by the gradient boosted trees regression. The only training method supported so far is the default dense method.
   * - ``loss``
     - ``squared``
     - Loss function type.

Prediction
----------

In addition to the common regression parameters, the gradient boosted
trees regression has the following parameters at the prediction stage:

     - Default Value
     - Description
   * - ``algorithmFPType``
     - ``float``
     - The floating-point type that the algorithm uses for intermediate computations. Can be ``float`` or ``double``.
   * - ``method``
     - ``defaultDense``
     - The computation method used by the gradient boosted trees regression. The only training method supported so far is the default dense method.
   * - ``numIterations``
     - :math:`0`
     - An integer parameter that indicates how many trained iterations of the
       model should be used in prediction. The default value :math:`0` denotes no
       limit. All the trained trees should be used.
