Classification Gradient Boosted Trees
=====================================

Gradient boosted trees classification is the special case of gradient
boosted trees. For more details, see Gradient Boosted Trees.

Details
*******

Given n feature vectors :math:`X = \{x_1 = (x_{11}, \ldots, x_{1p}), \ldots, x_n = (x_{n1}, \ldots, x_{np}) \}` of n
p-dimensional feature vectors and a vector of class labels :math:`y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n)`, where
:math:`y_i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, C-1\}` and
C is the number of classes, which describes the class to which the
feature vector :math:`x_i` belongs, the problem is to build a gradient
boosted trees classifier.

Training Stage
--------------

Gradient boosted trees classification follows the algorithmic
framework of gradient boosted trees training. For a classification
problem with K classes, K regression trees are constructed on each
iteration, one for each output class. The loss function is
cross-entropy (multinomial deviance):

.. math::
	L(y,f) = -\sum_{k=1}^{K}(I(y=k)\ln{p_{k}(x)})

where :math:`{p}_{k}(x)=\mathrm{ }\frac{{e}^{{f}_{k}\left(x\right)}}{\sum _{i=1}^{K}{e}^{{f}_{i}\left(x\right)}}`

Binary classification is a special case when single regression tree is trained on each iteration. The loss function is

.. math::
	L(y,f) = -(y\cdot \ln{\sigma(f)} + (1-y)\ln(1- \sigma(f)))

where :math:`\sigma(f)=\frac{1}{1+ {e}^{-f}}`

Prediction Stage
----------------

Given the gradient boosted trees classifier model and vectors :math:`(x_1, \ldots, x_r)`, the problem is to calculate labels for
those vectors. To solve the problem for each given feature vector
:math:`x_i`, the algorithm finds the leaf node in a tree in the
ensemble, and the leaf node gives the tree response. The algorithm
computes a sum of responses of all the trees for each class and
chooses the label y corresponding to the class with the maximal
response value (highest class probability).

Usage of Training Alternative
*****************************

To build a Gradient Boosted Trees Classification model using methods of the Model Builder class of Gradient Boosted Tree Classification,
complete the following steps:

- Create a Gradient Boosted Tree Classification model builder using a constructor with the required number of classes and trees.
- Create a decision tree and add nodes to it:

  - Use the ``createTree`` method with the required number of nodes in a tree and a label of the class for which the tree is created.
  - Use the ``addSplitNode`` and addLeafNode methods to add split and leaf nodes to the created tree.
    See the note below describing the decision tree structure.
  - After you add all nodes to the current tree, proceed to creating the next one in the same way.

- Use the ``getModel`` method to get the trained Gradient Boosted Trees Classification model after all trees have been created.

.. note::

  Each tree consists of internal nodes (called non-leaf or split nodes) and external nodes (leaf nodes).
  Each split node denotes a feature test that is a Boolean expression, for example,
  f < ``featureValue`` or f = ``featureValue``, where f is a feature and ``featureValue`` is a constant.
  The test type depends on the feature type: continuous, categorical, or ordinal.
  For more information on the test types, see :ref:`decision_tree`.

  The inducted decision tree is a binary tree, meaning that each non-leaf node has exactly two branches: true and false.
  Each split node contains featureIndex, the index of the feature used for the feature test in this node,
  and ``featureValue``, the constant for the Boolean expression in the test.
  Each leaf node contains a classLabel, the predicted class for this leaf.
  For more information on decision trees, see :ref:`decision_tree`.

  Add nodes to the created tree in accordance with the pre-calculated structure of the tree.
  Check that the leaf nodes do not have children nodes and that the splits have exactly two children.

Gradient boosted trees classification follows the general workflow
