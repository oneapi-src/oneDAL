Normalization
=============

Normalization is a set of algorithms intended to transform data before feeding it to some classes
of algorithms, for example, classifiers [James2013]_.
Normalization may improve computation accuracy and efficiency.
Different rules can be used to normalize data.
In |short_name|, two techniques to normalize data are implemented: z-score and min-max.
