Quality Metrics
===============

In |short_name|, a quality metric is a numerical characteristic or a set of connected numerical characteristics
that represents the qualitative aspect of the result returned by an algorithm:
a computed statistical estimate, model, or result of decision making.

A common set of quality metrics can be defined for some training and prediction algorithms.

A typical workflow with quality metric set is the following:

#.  Create a quality metric set object to compute quality metrics.

    - Set specific parameters for the algorithms.
    - Use the ``useDefaultMetrics`` flag to specify whether the default or user-defined quality metrics should be computed.

#. Get an input collection object using ``QualityMetricsId`` of a specific algorithm.
#. Set data to the input collection using the algorithm's ``InputId``.
#. Perform computation.
#. Get the resulting collection of quality metrics using the algorithm's ``ResultId``.

.. note::
    For values of ``InputId``, ``Parameters``, ``QualityMetricsId``, ``ResultId``,
    refer to the description of a specific algorithm.

Quality metrics are optional. They are computed when the computation is explicitly requested.
