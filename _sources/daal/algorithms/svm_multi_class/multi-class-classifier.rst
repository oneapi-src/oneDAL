Multi-class Classifier
======================

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 4

While some classification algorithms naturally permit the use of more
than two classes, some algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines
(SVM), are by nature solving a two-class problem only. These
two-class (or binary) classifiers can be turned into multi-class
classifiers by using different strategies, such as One-Against-Rest
or One-Against-One.

|product| implements a Multi-Class Classifier using the
One-Against-One strategy.

Multi-class classifiers, such as SVM, are based on two-class
classifiers, which are integral components of the models trained with
the corresponding multi-class classifier algorithms.


Details
*******

Given :math:`n` feature vectors :math:`x_1 = (x_{11}, \ldots, x_{1p}), \ldots, x_n = (x_{n1}, \ldots, x_{np})`
of size :math:`p`, the number of classes :math:`K`, and a vector of class labels
:math:`y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n)`, where :math:`y_i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, K-1\}`,
the problem is to build a multi-class classifier using a two-class
(binary) classifier, such as a two-class SVM.

Training Stage
--------------

The model is trained with the One-Against-One method that uses the
binary classification described in
[Hsu02]_ as follows:
For each pair of classes :math:`(i, j)`, train a binary classifier, such
as SVM. The total number of such binary classifiers is :math:`\frac{K(K-1)}{2}`.

Prediction Stage
----------------

Given a new feature vector :math:`x_i`, the classifier determines
the class to which the vector belongs.

|product| provides two methods for class label prediction:

-  Wu method. According to the algorithm 2 for computation of the
   class probabilities described in [Wu04]_.
   The library returns the index of the class with the largest
   probability.
-  Vote-based method. If the binary classifier predicts the
   feature vector to be in :math:`i`-th class, the number of votes for the
   class i is increased by one, otherwise the vote is given to the
   j-th class. If two classes have equal numbers of votes, the
   class with the smallest index is selected.

Usage of Training Alternative
*****************************

To build a Multi-class Classifier model using methods of the Model Builder class of Multi-class Classifier,
complete the following steps:

- Create a Multi-class Classifier model builder using a constructor with the required number of features and classes.
- Use the ``setTwoClassClassifierModel`` method for each pair of classes to add the pre-trained two-class classifiers to the model.
  In the parameters to the method specify the classes' indices and the pointer to the pre-trained two-class classifier for this pair of classes.
  You need to do this for each pair of classes, because the One-Against-One strategy is used.
- Use the ``getModel`` method to get the trained Multi-class Classifier model.
- Use the ``getStatus`` method to check the status of the model building process.
  If ``DAAL_NOTHROW_EXCEPTIONS`` macros is defined, the status report contains the list of errors
  that describe the problems API encountered (in case of API runtime failure).

Output
------

In addition to classifier output, multiclass classifier calculates the result described below.
Pass the ``Result ID`` as a parameter to the methods that access the result of your algorithm.
For more details, see :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Output for  Multi-class Classifier (Batch Processing)
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left

   * - Result ID
     - Result
   * - ``decisionFunction``
     - A numeric table of size :math:`n \times \frac{K(K-1)}{2}` containing the results of the decision function
       computed for all binary models when the ``computeDecisionFunction`` option is enabled.

.. note::

  If `resultsToEvaluate` does not contain `computeDecisionFunction`, the result of `decisionFunction` table is `NULL`.

  By default, each numeric table of this result is an object of the ``HomogenNumericTable`` class,
  but you can define the result as an object of any class derived from ``NumericTable``
  except for ``PackedSymmetricMatrix`` and ``PackedTriangularMatrix``.
