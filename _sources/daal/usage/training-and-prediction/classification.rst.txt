Classification Usage Model
==========================

A typical workflow for classification methods includes training and prediction, as explained below.

Algorithm-Specific Parameters
*****************************

The parameters used by classification algorithms at each stage depend on a specific algorithm. For a list of these parameters, refer to the description of an appropriate classification algorithm.

Training Stage
**************

    Classification Usage Model: Training Stage

At the training stage, classification algorithms accept the input described below.
Pass the ``Input ID`` as a parameter to the methods that provide input for your algorithm.
For more details, see :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Training Input for Classification Algorithms
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: longtable

   * - Input ID
     - Input
   * - ``data``
     - Pointer to the :math:`n \times p` numeric table with the training data set.
       This table can be an object of any class derived from ``NumericTable``.

   * - ``weights``
     - Weights of the observations in the training data set.
       Argument is optional, but it is required by the selected algorithms.

   * - ``labels``
     - Pointer to the :math:`n \times 1` numeric table with class labels.

       This table can be an object of any class derived from NumericTable except ``PackedSymmetricMatrix`` and ``PackedTriangularMatrix``.

At the training stage, classification algorithms calculate the result described below.
Pass the ``Result ID`` as a parameter to the methods that access the results of your algorithm.
For more details, see :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Training Output for Classification Algorithms
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Result ID
     - Result
   * - ``model``
     - Pointer to the classification model being trained. The result can only be an object of the ``Model`` class.

Prediction Stage
****************

    Classification Usage Model: Prediction Stage

At the prediction stage, classification algorithms accept the input described below.
Pass the ``Input ID`` as a parameter to the methods that provide input for your algorithm.
For more details, see :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Prediction Input for Classification Algorithms
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: longtable

   * - Input ID
     - Input
   * - ``data``
     - Pointer to the :math:`n \times p` numeric table with the working data set.
       This table can be an object of any class derived from ``NumericTable``.

   * - ``model``
     - Pointer to the trained classification model. This input can only be an object of the ``Model`` class.

At the prediction stage, classification algorithms calculate the result described below.
Pass the ``Result ID`` as a parameter to the methods that access the results of your algorithm.
For more details, see :ref:`algorithms`.

.. tabularcolumns::  |\Y{0.2}|\Y{0.8}|

.. list-table:: Prediction Output for Classification Algorithms
   :widths: 10 60
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: longtable

   * - Result ID
     - Result
   * - ``prediction``
     - Pointer to the :math:`n \times 1` numeric table with classification results (class labels or confidence levels).

       .. note::

          By default, this table is an object of the ``HomogenNumericTable`` class,
          but you can define it as an object of any class derived from ``NumericTable``
          except ``PackedSymmetricMatrix`` and ``PackedTriangularMatrix``.

   * - ``probabilities``
     - A numeric table of size :math:`n \times \text{nClasses}`, containing probabilities of classes computed when the
       ``computeClassProbabilities`` option is enabled. This result table is available for selected algorithms, see corresponding algorithm documentation for details.
   * - ``logProbabilities``
     - A numeric table of size :math:`n \times \text{nClasses}`, containing logarithms of classes' probabilities computed when the ``computeClassLogProbabilities`` option is enabled.
       This result table is available for selected algorithms, see corresponding algorithm documentation for details.

       .. note::

          By default, this table is an object of the ``HomogenNumericTable`` class,
          but you can define it as an object of any class derived from ``NumericTable``
          except ``PackedSymmetricMatrix``, ``PackedTriangularMatrix``, ``CSRNumericTable``.
