Data Compression
================

When large amounts of data are sent across devices or need to be
stored in memory or in a persistent storage, data compression enables
you to reduce network traffic, memory, and persistent storage
footprint. |short_name| implements several most popular generic
compression and decompression methods, which include ZLIB, LZO, RLE,
and BZIP2.

General API for Data Compression and Decompression
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The CompressionStream and DecompressionStream classes provide
general methods for data compression and decompression. The
following diagram illustrates the compression and decompression
flow at a high level:

  Data Compression and Decompression Flow

To define compression or decompression methods and related
parameters, provide Compressor or Decompressor objects as
arguments to CompressionStream or DecompressionStream constructors
respectively. For more details on Compressor and Decompressor,
refer to `Compression and Decompression Interfaces`_.

Use operator << of CompressionStream or DecompressionStream to
provide input data for compression or decompression stream. By
default, all compression and decompression stream methods allocate
the memory required to store results of compression and
decompression. For details of controlling memory allocation, refer
to `Compression and Decompression Interfaces`_.

The following methods are available to retrieve compressed data
stored in CompressionStream:

-  Copy compressed data blocks into a contiguous array using the
   copyCompressedArray() method.

   You can define the data blocks to copy by specifying the number
   of bytes to copy. The method copies the data from the beginning
   of the stream and removes the copied data from
   CompressionStream, so next time you call the
   copyCompressedArray() method, it copies the next block of data.
   To copy all the data, before a call to copyCompressedArray(),
   call the getCompressedBlocksSize() method to get the total size
   of compressed data in the stream.

-  Call the getCompressedBlocksCollection() method.

   Unlike the copyCompressedArray() method,
   getCompressedBlocksCollection() does not copy compressed blocks
   but provides a reference to the collection of compressed data
   blocks. The collection is available until you call the
   getCompressedBlocksCollection() method next time.

The following methods are available to retrieve decompressed data
stored in DecompressionStream:

-  Copy decompressed data blocks into a contiguous array using the
   copyDecompressedArray() method.

   You can define the data blocks to copy by specifying the number
   of bytes to copy. The method copies the data from the beginning
   of the stream and removes the copied data from
   DecompressionStream, so next time you call the
   copyDecompressedArray() method, it copies the next block of
   data. To copy all the data, before a call to
   copyDecompressedArray(), call the getDecompressedBlocksSize()
   method to get the total size of decompressed data in the
   stream.

-  Call the getDecompressedBlocksCollection() method.

   Unlike the copyDecompressedArray() method,
   getDecompressedBlocksCollection() does not copy decompressed
   blocks but provides a reference to the collection of
   decompressed data blocks. The collection is available until you
   call the getDecompressedBlocksCollection() method next time.

Compression and Decompression Interfaces
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CompressionStream and DecompressionStream classes cover most
typical usage scenarios. Therefore, you need to work directly with
Compressor and Decompressor objects only in the cases as follows:

-  CompressionStream and DecompressionStream classes do not cover
   your specific usage model.

-  You want to control memory allocation and deallocation for
   results of compression and decompression.

-  You need to modify compression and decompression default
   parameters.

The Compressor and Decompressor classes provide interfaces to
supported compression and decompression methods (ZLIB, LZO, RLE,
and BZIP2).

Compression and decompression objects are initialized with a set
of default parameters. You can modify parameters of a specific
compression method by accessing the parameter field of the
Compressor or Decompressor object.

To perform compression or decompression using the Compressor or
Decompressor classes, respectively, provide input data using the
setInputDataBlock() method and call the run() method. This
approach requires that you allocate and control the memory to
store the results of compression or decompression. In general, it
is impossible to accurately estimate the required size of the
output data block, and the memory you provide may be insufficient
to store results of compression or decompression. However, you can
check whether you need to allocate additional memory to continue
the run() operation. To do this, use the isOutputDataBlockFull()
method. You can also use the getUsedOutputDataBlockSize() method
to obtain the size of compressed or decompressed data actually
written to the output data block.

You can use your own compression and decompression methods in
CompressionStream and DecompressionStream. In this case, you need
to override Compressor and Decompressor objects.
