Data Serialization and Deserialization
======================================

|short_name| provides interfaces for serialization and deserialization
of data objects, which are an essential technique for data exchange
between devices and for implementing data recovery mechanisms on a
device failure.

The InputDataArchive class provides interfaces for creation of a
serialized object archive. The OutputDataArchive class provides
interfaces for deserialization of an object from the archive.

A general structure of an archive is as follows:

.. figure:: ./images/data-archive-structure.png
  :width: 400
  :alt: The first segment contains the archive header,
        the last segment contains the archive footer, and all
        other segments contain a segment header and a segment footer.

  Data Archive Structure

Headers and footers contain information required to reconstruct the
archived object.

All serializable objects, such as numeric tables, a data dictionary,
and models, have serialization and deserialization methods. These
methods take input archive and output archive, respectively, as
method parameters.
